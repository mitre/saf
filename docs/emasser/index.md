# SAF CLI eMASSer Features and Capabilities

## Environment Variables
To facilitate setting the required environment variables the `SAF CLI eMASSer` utilizes a zero-dependency module to load Required/Optional variables from a `.env` file.  See [Generating an eMASS Configuration File](#generating-an-emass-configuration-file)

### Configuring the `.env` File
An `.env-example` file is provided with the required and optional fields.

Modify the `.env-example` as necessary and save it as a `.env` file. 

Place the file on the  path where the `emasser` command is executed.

### Required Environment Variables
The following environment variables are required:
* EMASSER_API_KEY=`<API key>`
* EMASSER_HOST_URL=`<FQDN of the eMASS server>`
* EMASSER_KEY_FILE_PATH=`<<The eMASS key.pem private key file in PEM format (if provided, the CERT is required)>>`
* EMASSER_CERT_FILE_PATH=`<The eMASS client.pem certificate file in PEM format (if provided, the KEY is required)>`
* EMASSER_CA_FILE_PATH=`<The eMASS CA certificate (if provided no Key or Client PEM is needed)>`
* EMASSER_KEY_FILE_PASSWORD=`<The certificate passphrase>`

### Optional but required by most eMASS integrations
* EMASSER_USER_UID=`<Unique user identifier associated with the API Key (api-key)`
  
### Optional Environment Variables
The following environment variables are *optional:
* EMASSER_PORT=`<The server communication port number (default is 443)`
* EMASSER_REQUEST_CERT=`<Server requests a certificate from clients - true or false (default false)>`
* EMASSER_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=`<Reject connection not authorized with the list of supplied CAs- true or false (default true)>`
* EMASSER_DEBUGGING=`<set debugging - true or false (default false)>`
* EMASSER_CLI_DISPLAY_NULL=`<display null value fields - true or false (default true)>`
* EMASSER_EPOCH_TO_DATETIME=`<convert epoch to data/time value - true or false (default false)>`
* EMASSER_DOWNLOAD_DIR=`<directory where exported files are saved (default eMASSerDownloads)>`
  
\* If not provided defaults are used

The proper format to set these variables in the `.env` files is as follows:
```bash
[VARIABLE_NAME]='value'
```
***NOTE***

The `eMASSer` commands requires access to an eMASS instance. Authentication and authorization to an eMASS instance is **not** a function of `eMASSer CLI` and needs to be accomplished with the eMASS instance owner organization. Further information about eMASS credential requirements refer to [Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency](https://www.dcsa.mil/is/emass/) about eMASS access.

## Common eMASSer Endpoint Requests Information
  - The eMASS API provides the capability of updating multiple entries within several endpoints, however the `SAF CLI eMASSer`, in some cases only supports updating one entry at the time.

## Generating an eMASS Configuration File
Provided with the eMASS API CLI is an interactive command line user interface for generating the configuration file `.env` required to connect to an eMASS instance(s).

```
Generate a configuration file (.env) for accessing an eMASS instances.

USAGE
  $ saf emasser configure

DESCRIPTION
  Generate a configuration file (.env) for accessing an eMASS instances.
  Authentication to an eMASS instances requires a PKI-valid/trusted client
  certificate. The eMASSer CLI accepts a Key/Client pair certificates (.pem) or
  a CA certificate (.pem or .crt). A Unique user identifier (user-uid) is used by
  most eMASS integration, however certain integrations, the user-uid is not required


  Required eMASS configuration variables:
        EMASSER_API_KEY           <The eMASS API key (api-key) - valid key is > 30 alpha numeric characters>
        EMASSER_HOST_URL          <The Full Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) for the eMASS server>
        EMASSER_KEY_FILE_PATH     <The eMASS key.pem private key file in PEM format (if provided the CERT is required)>
        EMASSER_CERT_FILE_PATH    <The eMASS client.pem certificate file in PEM format (if provided the KEY is required)>
        EMASSER_CA_FILE_PATH      <The eMASS CA certificate (if provided no Key or Client PEM is needed)>
        EMASSER_KEY_FILE_PASSWORD <The password for the private encryption key.pem file>
  Certain eMASS integrations may not require (most do) this variable:
        EMASSER_USER_UID          <The eMASS User Unique Identifier (user-uid)>

  Optional eMASS configuration variables, if not provided defaults are used:
        EMASSER_PORT                <The server communication port number (default is 443)>
        EMASSER_REQUEST_CERT        <Server requests a certificate from connecting clients - true or false (default true)>
        EMASSER_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED <Reject clients with invalid certificates - true or false (default true)>
        EMASSER_DEBUGGING           <Set debugging on (true) or off (false) (default false)>
        EMASSER_CLI_DISPLAY_NULL    <Display null value fields - true or false (default true)>
        EMASSER_EPOCH_TO_DATETIME   <Convert epoch to data/time value - true or false (default false)>
        EMASSER_DOWNLOAD_DIR         <Directory where the CLI exports files (default eMASSerDownloads)>


EXAMPLES
  $ saf emasser configure
```

## Endpoints CLI help
To view eMASS API top help (available topics & commands) use the following command:

```
$ saf emasser [-h or -help]
[eMASS]        The eMASS REST API implementation

USAGE
  $ saf emasser COMMAND

```

Each CLI endpoint command have several layers of help. 
- Using `-h or -help` after a topic (command) `get, put, post, or delete` lists all available endpoint calls. The following command would list all available `GET` endpoints commands.
    ```
    $ saf emasser get [-h or -help]
    eMass REST API GET endpoint commands

    DESCRIPTION
      Retrieve artifacts for a system or system/filename combination
    ```
- Using `help` after any command lists all available options (flags). The following command would list all available options for the `get artifacts export` endpoint command. 
    ```
    $ emasser get artifacts export -help
    Retrieves the file artifacts (if compress is true the file binary contents are returned, otherwise the file textual contents are returned.)

      -C, --[no-]compress       Boolean - Compress true or false
      -P, --[no-]printToStdOut  Boolean - Print to standard output

    DESCRIPTION
      Retrieves an artifact file for selected system
      (file is sent to EMASSER_DOWNLOAD_DIR (defaults to eMASSerDownloads) if flag [-P, --printToStdOut] not provided)

    EXAMPLES
      $ saf emasser get artifacts export [-s, --systemId] <value> [-f, --filename] <value> [options]
    ```
**The same format is applicable for POST, PUT, and DELETE requests as well, however there may be additional help content**

## Command line flags
All command line flags have a short and long option, for example: -s or --systemId can be use as:
```
-s 36 or --systemId 36
```
Boolean `true/false` flags do **NOT** take an argument, they are reversed with `--no-` value. If we have a flag name `isTemplate` it would be uses as:
```
--isTemplate (true) --no-isTemplate (false)
```

## Usage - GET

### ```get test connection``` 
---
The Test Connection endpoint provides the ability to verify connection to the web service.

    $ emasser get test_connection

A return of success from the call indicates that the CLI can reach the configured server URL.

### ``post poams``
---
#### Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) add (POST) endpoint API business rules.

##### Requirements based on `status` field value

  |status          |Required Fields
  |----------------|--------------------------------------------------------
  |Risk Accepted   |`comments`, `resources`
  |Ongoing         |`scheduledCompletionDate`, `resources`, `milestones` (at least 1)
  |Completed       |`scheduledCompletionDate`, `comments`, `resources`, `completionDate`, `milestones` (at least 1)
  |Not Applicable  |POAM can not be created

##### POC fields requirements
If a POC email is supplied, the application will attempt to locate a user
already registered within the application and pre-populate any information
not explicitly supplied in the request. If no such user is found, these
fields are required within the request.
  - `pocOrganization`, `pocFirstName`, `pocLastName`, `pocEmail`, `pocPhoneNumber`

##### Business logic for adding POA&Ms
- POA&M Items cannot be saved if associated Security Control or AP is inherited.
- POA&M Items cannot be created manually if a Security Control or AP is Not Applicable.
- Completed POA&M Item cannot be saved if Completion Date is in the future.
- Completed POA&M Item cannot be saved if Completion Date (completionDate) is in the future.
- Risk Accepted POA&M Item cannot be saved with a Scheduled Completion Date or Milestones
- POA&M Items with a review status of "Not Approved" cannot be saved if Milestone Scheduled Completion Date exceeds POA&M Item  Scheduled Completion Date.
- POA&M Items with a review status of "Approved" can be saved if Milestone Scheduled Completion Date exceeds POA&M Item Scheduled Completion Date.
- POA&M Items that have a status of "Completed" and a status of "Ongoing" cannot be saved without Milestones.
- POA&M Items that have a status of "Risk Accepted" cannot have milestones.
- POA&M Items with a review status of "Approved" that have a status of "Completed" and "Ongoing" cannot update Scheduled Completion Date.
- POA&M Items that have a review status of "Approved" are required to have a Severity Value assigned.
- POA&M Items cannot be updated if they are included in an active package.
- Archived POA&M Items cannot be updated.
- POA&M Items with a status of "Not Applicable" will be updated through test result creation.
- If the Security Control or Assessment Procedure does not exist in the system we may have to just import POA&M Item at the System Level.

##### POA&M parameters/fields character limitations
- Fields that can not exceed 100 characters:
  - Office / Organization (`pocOrganization`)
  - First Name            (`pocFirstName`)
  - Last Name             (`pocLastName`)

### ``post artifacts``
---
#### Upload artifacts one or many artifacts in a system

The body of a request through the Artifacts POST endpoint accepts a single binary file.
Two Artifact POST methods are currently accepted: individual and bulk.
Filename uniqueness within an eMASS system will be enforced by the API for both methods.
For POST requests that should result in a single artifact, the request should include the file.

#### Business rules
Upon successful receipt of one or many artifacts, if a file is matched via filename to an
artifact existing within the application, the file associated with the artifact will be updated.
If no artifact is matched via filename to the application, a new artifact will be created with
the following default values. Any values not specified below will be null.
```shell
  - isTemplate: false
  - type: other
  - category: evidence
```
Any values not specified below will be null.

#### Artifacts rules and limitations
- Artifact cannot be saved if File Name (fileName) exceeds 1,000 characters
- Artifact cannot be saved if Name (name) exceeds 100 characters
- Artifact cannot be saved if Description (description) exceeds 10,000 characters
- Artifact cannot be saved if Reference Page Number (refPageNumber) exceeds 50 characters
- Artifact cannot be saved if the file does not have an allowable file extension/type.
- Artifact version cannot be saved if an Artifact with the same file name already exist in the system.
- Artifact cannot be saved if the file size exceeds 30MB.
- Artifact cannot be saved if the Last Review Date is set in the future.
- Artifact cannot be saved if the following fields are missing data:
  -  Filename
  -  Type
  -  Category

### ```post device scan results```
---
Add (upload) device scan results in the assets module for a system

#### Business Rules
The body of a request through the Device Scan Results POST endpoint accepts a single binary file.
Specific file extensions are expected depending upon the scanType parameter.
For example, .ckl or .cklb files are accepted when using scanType is set to disaStigViewerCklCklb.

When the scan type is an acasAsrArf or policyAuditor, a .zip file is expected which should contain
a single scan result (for example, a single pair of .asr and .arf files).

Single files are expected for all other scan types as this endpoint requires files to be uploaded consecutively as opposed to in bulk.

Current scan types that are supported:
 - ACAS: ASR/ARF
 - ACAS: NESSUS
 - DISA STIG Viewer: CKL/CKLB
 - DISA STIG Viewer: CMRS
 - Policy Auditor
 - SCAP Compliance Checker

The parameter (flag) isBaseline (Boolean) is used if the imported file represents a baseline scan.
Importing as a baseline scan, which assumes a common set of scan policies are used when conducting
a scan, will replace a device's findings for a specific Benchmark.

**NOTE:** Applicable to ASR/ARF scans only.


#### Add (POST) a Scan Result CLI usages
```shell
  USAGE
    $ saf emasser post device_scans [FLAGS]

  FLAGS
    -h, --help               Show eMASSer CLI help for the POST Device Scan Results command

    -B, --[no-]isBaseline    Indicates if the scan is a baseline scan

  DESCRIPTION
    Add (upload) device scan results in the assets module for a system
    Supported scan types: ACAS, DISA STIG Viewer, Policy Auditor, SCAP Compliance Checker
    See the [-S, --scanType] command line flag for acceptable option names for scan type

  EXAMPLES

### ``put poams``
----
#### Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) update (PUT) endpoint API business rules.

#### Requirements based on `status` field value

  |status          |Required Fields
  |----------------|--------------------------------------------------------
  |Risk Accepted   |`comments`, `resources`
  |Ongoing         |`scheduledCompletionDate`, `resources`, `milestones` (at least 1)
  |Completed       |`scheduledCompletionDate`, `comments`, `resources`, `completionDate`, `milestones` (at least 1)
  |Not Applicable  |POAM can not be created

#### POC fields requirements
If a POC email is supplied, the application will attempt to locate a user already registered within the application and pre-populate any information not explicitly supplied in the request. If no such user is found, these fields are required within the request.
  - pocOrganization, pocFirstName, pocLastName, pocEmail, pocPhoneNumber

#### Business logic for updating POA&Ms
- POA&M Item cannot be saved if associated Security Control or AP is inherited.
- POA&M Item cannot be created manually if a Security Control or AP is Not Applicable.
- Completed POA&M Item cannot be saved if Completion Date is in the future.
- Completed POA&M Item cannot be saved if Completion Date (completionDate) is in the future.
- Risk Accepted POA&M Item cannot be saved with a Scheduled Completion Date (scheduledCompletionDate) or Milestones
- POA&M Item with a review status of "Not Approved" cannot be saved if Milestone Scheduled Completion Date exceeds POA&M Item  Scheduled Completion Date.
- POA&M Item with a review status of "Approved" can be saved if Milestone Scheduled Completion Date exceeds POA&M Item Scheduled Completion Date.
- POA&M Items that have a status of "Completed" and a status of "Ongoing" cannot be saved without Milestones.
- POA&M Items that have a status of "Risk Accepted" cannot have milestones.
- POA&M Items with a review status of "Approved" that have a status of "Completed" and "Ongoing" cannot update Scheduled Completion Date.
- POA&M Items that have a review status of "Approved" are required to have a Severity Value assigned.
- POA&M Items cannot be updated if they are included in an active package.
- Archived POA&M Items cannot be updated.
- POA&M Items with a status of "Not Applicable" will be updated through test result creation.
- If the Security Control or Assessment Procedure does not exist in the system we may have to just import POA&M Item at the System Level.


The following parameters/fields have the following character limitations:
- POA&M Item cannot be saved if the Point of Contact fields exceed 100 characters:
  - Office / Organization (pocOrganization)
  - First Name            (pocFirstName)
  - Last Name             (pocLastName)
  - Email                 (email)
  - Phone Number          (pocPhoneNumber)
- POA&M Item cannot be saved if Mitigation field (mitigation) exceeds 2,000 characters.
- POA&M Item cannot be saved if Source Identifying Vulnerability field (sourceIdentVuln) exceeds 2,000 characters.
- POA&M Item cannot be saved if Comments field (comments) exceeds 2,000 characters 
- POA&M Item cannot be saved if Resource field (resource) exceeds 250 characters.
- POA&M Items cannot be saved if Milestone Description (description) exceeds 2,000 characters.


#### POA&M parameters/fields character limitations
- Fields that can not exceed 100 characters:
  - Office / Organization (`pocOrganization`)
  - First Name            (`pocFirstName`)
  - Last Name             (`pocLastName`)
