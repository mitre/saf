# Release-Please Setup for SAF CLI

**Status**: ✅ Ready to Use
**Implementation Date**: October 8, 2025
**Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with ci-pr.yml, ci-main.yml, cd-release.yml

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Release-Please Workflow
**File**: `.github/workflows/release-please.yml`

**What It Does**:
- Runs on every push to main
- Analyzes commits using conventional commits
- Auto-generates changelog from commit messages
- Auto-bumps version (patch/minor/major based on commits)
- Creates/updates a Release PR with all changes
- When Release PR merged → Creates GitHub release + git tag
- GitHub release triggers cd-release.yml (all publishing happens automatically!)

### 2. Configuration Files

**`.release-please-config.json`**:
- Configures Release-Please for SAF CLI
- Sets up changelog sections
- Defines version file updates (package.json only)
- Tag format: `v1.5.1` (includes 'v' prefix)

**`.release-please-manifest.json`**:
- Tracks current version: `1.5.1`
- Release-Please updates this automatically
- Single source of truth

**`.commitlintrc.json`**:
- Enforces conventional commit format
- Valid types: feat, fix, docs, refactor, perf, test, ci, chore, security
- Valid scopes: attest, convert, emasser, generate, validate, view, threshold, etc.
- Max header length: 100 characters

### 3. Commit Validation Workflow
**File**: `.github/workflows/validate-commits.yml`

**What It Does**:
- Validates PR commit messages follow conventional commits
- Comments on PR if validation fails
- Provides helpful examples and guidance
- Ensures Release-Please can work correctly

---

## How It Works

### Step-by-Step Flow

```
1. Developer creates PR with conventional commits
   Example: "feat(convert): add Trivy SBOM support"

   ↓

2. validate-commits.yml checks format
   ✅ Valid format → PR passes
   ❌ Invalid → Bot comments with help

   ↓

3. PR reviewed and merged to main

   ↓

4. release-please.yml runs automatically
   - Analyzes all commits since last release
   - Determines version bump:
     * feat: → minor (1.5.1 → 1.6.0)
     * fix: → patch (1.5.1 → 1.5.2)
     * feat!: or BREAKING CHANGE → major (1.5.1 → 2.0.0)
   - Generates beautiful changelog
   - Updates package.json version
   - Creates/updates "chore: release 1.6.0" PR

   ↓

5. Team reviews Release PR
   - See what's being released
   - Review generated changelog
   - Approve or request changes

   ↓

6. Merge Release PR

   ↓

7. Release-Please automatically:
   - Creates git tag (v1.6.0)
   - Creates GitHub release
   - Uses generated changelog as release notes

   ↓

8. cd-release.yml triggers (release: published)
   - Runs quality gate (all 695 tests)
   - Runs security scan
   - Builds all installers
   - Publishes to NPM
   - Publishes to Docker Hub
   - Updates Homebrew
   - Uploads installers to GitHub release

   ↓

9. Release complete! Available on all channels
```

## Conventional Commit Format

### Basic Structure
```
type(scope): subject

body (optional)

footer (optional)
```

### Types and What They Trigger

| Type | Example | Version Bump | When to Use |
|------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| `feat` | `feat(convert): add Trivy support` | **minor** (1.5.1 → 1.6.0) | New features |
| `fix` | `fix(threshold): correct path parser` | **patch** (1.5.1 → 1.5.2) | Bug fixes |
| `perf` | `perf(docker): use native builds` | **patch** | Performance improvements |
| `feat!` | `feat(api)!: change CLI arguments` | **major** (1.5.1 → 2.0.0) | Breaking changes |
| `docs` | `docs(readme): update examples` | none | Documentation only |
| `ci` | `ci: add release-please` | none | CI/CD changes |
| `refactor` | `refactor(threshold): extract helpers` | none | Code restructuring |
| `test` | `test(utils): add path-parser tests` | none | Test additions |
| `chore` | `chore(deps): update dependencies` | none | Maintenance |
| `security` | `security(ci): pin actions to SHA` | **patch** | Security fixes |

### Breaking Changes

**Using `!` suffix**:
```
feat(cli)!: change default output format

BREAKING CHANGE: Default format changed from JSON to YAML
```

**Using footer**:
```
feat(api): improve error messages

BREAKING CHANGE: Error codes now use ERR_ prefix instead of E_
```

Both trigger **major** version bump (1.5.1 → 2.0.0)

---

## Examples from SAF CLI

### Feature Addition (minor bump)
```
feat(convert): add support for Checkmarx SAST results

Adds new converter for Checkmarx SAST XML output to HDF format.
Includes full test coverage and documentation.
```
**Result**: 1.5.1 → 1.6.0

### Bug Fix (patch bump)
```
fix(threshold): parseThresholdPath handles status.total correctly

Fixed bug where all 2-part paths were treated as compliance paths,
causing incorrect status count lookups.

Fixes #2196
```
**Result**: 1.5.1 → 1.5.2

### Multiple Features in One Release
```
# PR 1
feat(validate): add JUnit XML output format

# PR 2
feat(threshold): add filtering by severity

# PR 3
fix(docker): update base image

When Release PR created, it will:
- Bump to 1.6.0 (two features = minor)
- Changelog will list all three
```

## What Gets Deprecated

### ❌ No Longer Needed

1. **VERSION file** - package.json is now single source of truth
2. **release-pre.sh** - Release-Please handles version bumping
3. **release-pre.ps1** - Release-Please handles version bumping
4. **Manual git tag commands** - Release-Please creates tags
5. **Manual version editing** - Release-Please updates package.json
6. **Manual changelog writing** - Release-Please generates it

### ✅ Still Needed

1. **cd-release.yml** - Still builds and publishes everything
2. **GitHub release creation** - Release-Please does this automatically
3. **Quality gates** - cd-release.yml still enforces them
4. **Dry-run mode** - cd-release.yml still supports manual testing

---

## First Release After Setup

### What Happens

1. **Merge this PR** (feature/cicd-pipeline-reorg)
2. **Release-Please creates a PR** titled "chore: release 1.5.2" (or similar)
   - Contains all unreleased commits
   - Includes generated CHANGELOG.md
   - Updates package.json to new version
3. **Review Release PR**:
   - Check changelog accuracy
   - Verify version bump is correct
   - Approve if looks good
4. **Merge Release PR**
5. **GitHub release auto-created**
6. **cd-release.yml runs** automatically
7. **Release published** to all channels!

---

## Configuration Details

### Version Bumping Rules

- `fix:`, `perf:`, `security:` → patch (1.5.1 → 1.5.2)
- `feat:` → minor (1.5.1 → 1.6.0)
- `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` → major (1.5.1 → 2.0.0)
- `docs:`, `ci:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `refactor:` → no release

### Changelog Sections

The generated changelog will have sections:
- **Features** - All `feat:` commits
- **Bug Fixes** - All `fix:` commits
- **Performance Improvements** - All `perf:` commits
- **Security** - All `security:` commits
- **Code Refactoring** - All `refactor:` commits (hidden by default)
- **Documentation** - All `docs:` commits (hidden by default)
- **Tests** - All `test:` commits (hidden by default)
- **CI/CD** - All `ci:` commits (hidden by default)
- **Miscellaneous** - All `chore:` commits (hidden by default)

### Tag Format

- Format: `v1.5.1` (includes 'v' prefix)
- Example: `v1.5.1`, `v2.0.0`, `v1.6.0-alpha.1`

---

## Testing Before Production

### Dry-Run a Release

1. **Create test release manually**:
   ```bash
   gh workflow run cd-release.yml \
     --ref main \
     -f version=v99.99.99-test \
     -f dry-run=true
   ```

2. **Watch it run**:
   - Tests will run
   - Installers will build
   - npm publish --dry-run will validate
   - Docker will build (not push)
   - Nothing actually publishes

3. **Verify everything works**

---

## Team Training

### For Developers

**What changes**:
- ✅ Use conventional commit format (already doing this!)
- ✅ That's it!

**What stays the same**:
- PR workflow unchanged
- Code review unchanged
- Testing unchanged

### For Release Managers

**What changes**:
- ✅ Review Release PR instead of running scripts
- ✅ Merge Release PR instead of manual steps
- ✅ That's it!

**What stays the same**:
- Still have control (approve/reject Release PR)
- Still can create manual releases (workflow_dispatch)
- Quality gates still enforced

---

## Troubleshooting

### Release PR Not Created

**Cause**: No releasable commits since last release
**Solution**: Only `feat:`, `fix:`, `perf:`, `security:` trigger releases

### Wrong Version Bump

**Cause**: Commit type incorrect
**Solution**: Use `feat:` for minor, `fix:` for patch, add `!` for major

### Changelog Missing Commits

**Cause**: Commits don't follow conventional format
**Solution**: validate-commits.yml will catch this on PRs

### Need Emergency Release

**Solution**: Still have manual workflow_dispatch on cd-release.yml

---

## Files Modified

**New Files**:
- `.github/workflows/release-please.yml`
- `.github/workflows/validate-commits.yml`
- `.release-please-config.json`
- `.release-please-manifest.json`
- `.commitlintrc.json`

**Modified Files**:
- None! Release-Please integrates with existing cd-release.yml

**Deprecated** (can remove later):
- `release-pre.sh`
- `release-pre.ps1`
- `VERSION` file (after confirming package.json is sufficient)
