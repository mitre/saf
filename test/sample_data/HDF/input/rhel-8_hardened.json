Once the information is passed outside the control of the information system, additional means may be required to ensure the constraints remain in effect. While the older, more traditional definitions of discretionary access control require identity-based access control, that limitation is not required for this use of discretionary access control.\n\n    By enabling the fs.protected_hardlinks kernel parameter, users can no longer create soft or hard links to files they do not own. Disallowing such hardlinks mitigate vulnerabilities based on insecure file system accessed by privileged programs, avoiding an exploitation vector exploiting unsafe use of open() or creat().\n\n    The sysctl --system command will load settings from all system configuration files.

Audit processing\nfailures include software/hardware errors; failures in the audit capturing\nmechanisms; and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded. Responses to\naudit failure depend upon the nature of the failure mode.\n\n    When availability is an overriding concern, other approved actions in\nresponse to an audit failure are as follows:\n\n    1) If the failure was caused by the lack of audit record storage capacity,\nRHEL 8 must continue generating audit records if possible (automatically\nrestarting the audit service if necessary) and overwriting the oldest audit\nrecords in a first-in-first-out manner.\n\n    2) If audit records are sent to a centralized collection server and\ncommunication with this server is lost or the server fails, RHEL 8 must queue\naudit records locally until communication is restored or until the audit\nrecords are retrieved manually. Upon restoration of the connection to the\ncentralized collection server, action should be taken to synchronize the local\naudit data with the collection server.'\n  desc 'check', 'Verify RHEL 8 takes the appropriate action when the audit storage volume is\nfull.\n\n    Check that RHEL 8 takes the appropriate action when the audit storage\nvolume is full with the following command:\n\n    $ sudo grep disk_full_action /etc/audit/auditd.conf\n\n    disk_full_action = HALT\n\n    If the value of the \"disk_full_action\" option is not \"SYSLOG\",\n\"SINGLE\", or \"HALT\", or the line is commented out, ask the system\nadministrator to indicate how the system takes appropriate action when an audit\nstorage volume is full.

In addition, quickly terminating an idle SSH session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element.\n\nTerminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, deallocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level and deallocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. This does not mean that the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the unresponsive session and releases the resources associated with that session.\n\nRHEL 8 uses /etc/ssh/sshd_config for configurations of OpenSSH. Within the sshd_config, the product of the values of \"ClientAliveInterval\" and \"ClientAliveCountMax\" is used to establish the inactivity threshold. The \"ClientAliveInterval\" is a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The \"ClientAliveCountMax\" is the number of client alive messages that may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is met, sshd will disconnect the client. For more information on these settings and others, refer to the sshd_config man pages.",
