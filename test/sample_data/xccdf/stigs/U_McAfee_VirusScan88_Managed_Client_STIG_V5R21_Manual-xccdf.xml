</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Interpreted viruses are executed by an application. Within this subcategory, macro viruses take advantage of the capabilities of applications' macro programming language to infect application documents and document templates, while scripting viruses infect scripts that are understood by scripting languages processed by services on the OS. Many attackers use toolkits containing several different types of utilities and scripts that can be used to probe and attack hosts. (NIST SP 800-83) The scanning of scripts is crucial in preventing these attacks.

</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Buffer overflow is an anomaly where a program, while writing data to a buffer, overruns the buffer's boundary and overwrites adjacent memory. This anomaly has been used maliciously, explicitly to craft exploits. Buffer overflow attacks compose greater than 25% of malware attacks. Without buffer overflow protection enabled, systems are more vulnerable to attacks that attempt to overwrite adjacent memory in the stack frame. Protection mode will ensure buffer overflow is detected and blocked. Otherwise, only a warning message will be logged. Buffer overflow protection is only configurable on non-64-bit systems.

With File Reputation lookup, a more real-time response to potential malicious code is realized than with the local-running antivirus software, since by querying the cloud-based database when a file appears to be suspicious, up-to-the-minute intelligence is provided.

Most viruses need to be run once by a person before infecting a computer. This can be done in many ways, such as opening an executable attachment in an email or downloading a program from the Internet. An executable needs to exist on the disk before Windows can run it. A common way for applications to achieve this is to save the file in the user's or system's Temp directory and then run it. One purpose of this rule is to enforce advice that is frequently given to users: "don't open attachments from email." The other purpose of this rule is to close security holes introduced by application bugs. Older versions of Outlook and Internet Explorer are notorious for automatically executing code without the user needing to do anything but preview an email or view a website.

</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Antivirus software vendors use collective intelligence from sensors and cross-vector intelligence from web, email, and network threats to compile scores that reflect the likelihood of whether a file in question is malware. The collective intelligence is constantly being updated, more frequently than the typical daily antivirus signature files. With File Reputation lookup, a more real-time response to potential malicious code is realized than with the local-running antivirus software, since by querying the cloud-based database when a file appears to be suspicious, up-to-the-minute intelligence is provided. This type of protection reduces the threat protection time period from days to milliseconds, increases malware detection rates, and reduces downtime and remediation costs associated with malware attacks. Using File Reputation lookup is mandated by US CYBERCOM on DoD systems.

User awareness and training, warning users to not open suspicious emails or email attachments, and not clicking on hyperlinks, etc. from unknown or known senders, will not fully protect from email-borne malware. Mass mailing worms are similar to email-borne viruses, but are self-contained, rather than infecting an existing file. Protecting from email-borne viruses and mass mailing worms by scanning email upon delivery mitigates the risk of infection via email.
