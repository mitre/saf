This same sensitivity is included in VTUs that are used in office spaces. This has one disadvantage. The microphones can pick up sidebar conversations that have no relationship to the conference or call in progress. Likewise, in an open area, received conference audio can be broadcast to others in the area that are not part of the conference, and possibly should not be exposed to the conference information for need-to-know reasons. Speakerphones exhibit a similar vulnerability. This is the same confidentiality vulnerability posed to audible sound information in the environment as discussed above with the added twist that the conference audio is vulnerable to others in the environment. While this is more of an issue in environments where classified conversations normally occur, it is also an issue in any environment. This is of particularly concern in open work areas or open offices where multiple people work in near proximity. Users or operators of VTC systems of any type must take care regarding who can hear what is being said during a conference call and what unrelated conversations can be picked up by the sensitive microphone. Where a VTU is used by a single person in an open area, a partial mitigation for this could be the use of a headset with earphones and a microphone. While this would limit the ability of others to hear audio from the conference and could also limit the audio pickup of unrelated conversations, it may not be fully effective. In some instances, such as when a VTU is located in a SCIF, a Push-to-Talk (PTT) handset/headset may be required Microphones embedded in or connected to a communications endpoint, PC, or PC monitor can be sensitive enough to pick up sound that is not related to a given communications session. They could pick up nearby conversations and other sounds. This capability could compromise sensitive or classified information that is not related to the communications in progress. Speakers embedded in or connected to a communications endpoint or PC can be made loud enough to be heard across a room or in the next workspace. This capability could compromise sensitive or classified information that is being communicated during a session. Users must be aware of other conversations in the area and their sensitivity when using any communications endpoint, not only a PC based voice, video, or collaboration communications application. This awareness must then translate into protecting or eliminating these other conversations. A short range, reduced gain, or noise canceling microphone may be required. A push to talk microphone may also be required for classified areas. The microphone should be muted when the user is not speaking as both mitigation for this issue, and for proper etiquette when participating in a conference. The muting function should be performed using a positively controlled disconnect, shorting switch, or mechanism instead of a software controlled mute function on the PC. Users must be aware of other people in the area that could hear what is being communicated. This is particularly an issue if the communicated information is sensitive or classified since the parties overhearing the information may not have proper clearance or a need-to-know. To mitigate this issue, a headset or speakers should be used and at a volume that only the user can hear.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Manager&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;DCBP-1, ECND-1, ECSC-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target VTC Endpoint Site/System/Enclave</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>VTC Endpoint Site/System/Enclave</dc:subject><dc:identifier>1418</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-16180r2_fix">Ensure a policy and procedure is in place and enforced that addresses the placement and operation of hardware based voice and video communications devices and PC based voice, video, UC, and collaboration communications applications with regard to their audio pickup and broadcast capabilities in relation to the sensitivity of the information communicated.

If video displays associated with communications devices and PC based voice, video, UC, and collaboration communications applications are used to display sensitive or classified information, interview the IAO and inspect the applicable SOP.  The SOP should address the positioning of video displays associated with communications devices and PC based voice, video, UC, and collaboration communications applications with regard to the sensitivity of the information displayed and the ability of individuals, not part of the communications session, to view the display.

Inspect a random sampling of workspaces and conference rooms to determine compliance. Look for displays that are viewable through a window or are viewable from common walkways or areas where non-participants can view the information. The lack of partitions or the use of short partitions separating workspaces can be an issue depending upon the sensitivity of the displayed information.

Inspect user training materials and discuss practices to determine if information regarding the SOP is conveyed. Interview a random sampling of users to confirm their awareness of the SOP and related information.

This is a finding if video displays associated with communications devices and PC based voice, video, UC, and collaboration communications applications that are used to display sensitive or classified information are easily viewable from locations outside the immediate user’s work area. This is also a finding if the SOP or training is deficient.

NOTE: During a SRR, the review of this check may be coordinated with a traditional security reviewer if one is available so that duplication of effort is minimized. However, the similar/related traditional security check primarily addresses displays that are attached to classified systems which are displaying classified information, and not sensitive but unclassified information or privacy information.

While the technology for doing this is different between hardware based VTC endpoints and PC based application endpoints, the vulnerability is the same. In both cases, the displayed information typically resides on a PC. While in presentation/sharing mode, care must be exercised so that the PC user does not inadvertently display and transmit information on their workstation which is not part of the communications session and not intended to be viewed by the other communicating parties. Users must be aware that anything they display on their PC monitor while presenting to a communications session may be displayed on the other communicating endpoints. This is particularly true when the PC video output is connected to a VTC CODEC since the information will be displayed on all of the conference monitors. This presentation/sharing feature could result in the disclosure of sensitive or classified information to individuals that do not have a validated need-to-know or have the proper clearance to view the information. Thus the presentation/sharing feature presents a vulnerability to other information displayed on the PC if the feature is misused. This is a problem when sharing (displaying) a PC desktop via any collaboration tool using any connection method. There is little that can be done to mitigate this vulnerability other than to develop policy and procedures to present to collaborative communications sessions. All users which perform this function must have awareness of the issues and be trained in the proper operational procedures. Such procedures may require that there be no non-session related documents or windows open or minimized on the PC while presenting or sharing. An additional requirement may be that the user may not permit others in a session to remotely control their PC. A SOP is needed that addresses mitigations for the vulnerabilities posed by PC data and presentation sharing. Such an SOP could include the following discussion. If a user needs to view non meeting related information while presenting to a conference, the PC external display port must be turned off or better yet, the cable disconnected. Dual monitor operation of the PC could mitigate this problem somewhat. The second monitor output would be connected to the CODEC which would serve as the second monitor. Using this method, any information may be viewed on the native PC monitor while the presentation can be displayed on the VTU presentation screen. &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;NONE&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;The inadvertent and/or improper disclosure of sensitive or classified information to a caller of a VTU that may not have an appropriate need-to-know or proper security clearance.&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Other&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Manager&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target VTC Endpoint Site/System/Enclave</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>VTC Endpoint Site/System/Enclave</dc:subject><dc:identifier>1418</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-16183r1_fix">Ensure a policy and procedure is in place and enforced that addresses the proper implementation and use of the “Presentation and Sharing” features of collaboration applications and devices.

     </title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;An established and/or open configuration/administration (user or administrator) session that is inactive, idle, or unattended is an avenue for unauthorized access to the management port/interface of the VTU. This can lead to compromise of the system’s/device’s configuration and/or denial of service. Idle sessions can be caused simply by a user or administrator being distracted or diverted from a configuration/administration session/task or by forgetting to log out of the management session when finished with his/her tasks. To ensure that the capability for unauthorized access in the event of an idle/inactive session is mitigated; an idle/inactive session timeout/logout capability must exist and be used. The timeout duration must be configurable to adjust for changing policies and requirements. Typically this duration should be set for 15 minutes as a maximum; however it can be shortened for tighter security. This requirement applies to all types of local and remote management connections/sessions and all management session protocols.

While not specifically related to VTC, this requirement can work against or inhibit certain management functions. System/device configuration backups or software upgrades requiring file transfers may exceed the idle timeout duration. In this case, the operation might fail if the idle timer disconnected the session midway through. During such events, the idle timer should recognize this activity as the session not being idle. Alternately, the idle timer duration may be extended or may be disabled as long as it is re-enabled/reset after the file transfer. Another management function that can be inhibited by an idle session timeout is when a session is required to be established for the continuous monitoring of the system/device. In this case, the idle timer may be disabled as long as it is re-enabled after the monitoring is no longer needed.

This permits a workstation user to view the conference in near real time but not to participate in it. VTUs may also stream other content such as pre-recorded media played from a VCR or similar media source and some VTUs support streaming while others do not. It seems that as vendors mature their streaming server technology and more products become available, they are removing the streaming capability from the CODEC where it presents greater vulnerability. 
     
Streaming from a VTU’s CODEC can also be used to record a conference by sending the stream to a recording/streaming server that can perform the recording function. These servers also serve as streaming distribution points. Recording/Streaming servers are discussed later. 
     
While streaming from a CODEC most often uses IP multicast, streams can also be sent to one receiver (e.g., PC or recording/distribution server), or to multiple receivers in the local broadcast domain 
     
IP multicast or broadcast streaming works best within a LAN where ample bandwidth is available and IP multicast is supported.  While multicast streaming is conceivable across a WAN such as the Internet, it is much less feasible and less reliable due to limited multicast support and access circuit bandwidth constraints. To use IP multicast, the network elements must be configured to support it.
     
To enable streaming, the following configuration items are needed:
     
- Destination address, unicast (address of specific destination, client or server), broadcast (local subnet or global), multicast (address configured on a router in the range 224.0.0.1-239.255.255.255)
- IP port(s) (some CODECs may require one port for audio and one for video)
- Time-To-Live (TTL) (i.e., number of router hops or routers to traverse) 
     
VTU Streaming can typically be activated by a user selecting it from a menu. It could also be possible to activate it by the simple press of a button on the remote control. As such, it could be possible to activate streaming by accident when it is not desired or required. Additionally, some VTUs permit a remote user to activate the feature. 
     
The “broadcast” or stream is received by a compatible client running on a PC. Examples of clients used are RealMedia Player™, Apple Quicktime™, VIC, or Cisco IP/TV. 
     
To receive a multicast stream, the recipient can do one of the following two things:
     
- First, they can use a web browser to access the IP address of the CODEC that is streaming. The user accesses the CODEC’s web page and clicks a link to receive the stream. This causes the browser to download an .sdp file (e.g., filename.sdp) that contains information about the stream and launch the streaming client. The .sdp file tells the client what IP address and port the stream can be found on as well as the compression types (protocols) being used. Accessing the streaming web page or .sdp file typically requires the use of a password before gaining access. Some vendors use the administrator password (not acceptable) while others use a “meeting password” In some cases the recipient (remote user) can also activate streaming (i.e., cause the CODEC to begin streaming) from this web page if it is not already activated. 
- The second method of access is essentially direct. The recipient uses the streaming client to retrieve the .sdp file from the CODECs IP address. Some streaming clients can access a multicast stream without the use of an .sdp file.
     
The only access control for streaming is that imposed by the CODEC for accessing its web page and/or retrieving the .sdp file. While this is effective using clients such as RealMedia Player™, Apple Quicktime™, which require the .sdp file information to function, there are other clients that do not. Using a client that does not, once the CODEC is streaming, anyone knowing the IP address and port for the stream can view the stream. There is no access control for viewing a media stream in this manner because IP provides no access control for joining an IP multicast group.
     
When streaming, there is no way of knowing who or how many recipients are viewing a conference. The number of possible recipients is virtually unlimited. Typically, there is only an indication on the VTU screen that the CODEC is streaming. Again, some VTUs permit streaming to be activated remotely by anybody who knows the IP address of the VTU and can access its streaming web page. As such, it could be possible for an unauthorized person to activate streaming and eavesdrop on the room or a conference in session. These vulnerabilities can greatly jeopardize the confidentiality of any given conference by broadcasting it on the connected LAN to indeterminate numbers of unknown recipients. 
     
An additional vulnerability that streaming presents to any conference, whether hosted on a central MCU, point-to-point, or a MCU integrated unto a VTU is that any meeting participant could accidentally or maliciously stream the meeting from their VTU if their VTU supports streaming. For these reasons, the activation and use of streaming from a VTU/CODEC is discouraged and must be tightly controlled by all IAOs who are responsible for any streaming capable VTU that might participate in a conference. CODECs must be configured in such a way that if streaming is activated, the stream can only be accessed by authorized individuals or be non-functional or inaccessible if activated by accident.
     
Generally speaking, the use of streaming to an IP multicast or broadcast address should never be used or activated unless it is required to fulfill a specific, validated, authorized, and documented mission requirement. This applies to both streaming from a CODEC or a recording/streaming server because of the inherent lack of full user/recipient access control. Streaming to a unicast address, i.e., one recipient, from a CODEC should be the only method used. The one recipient should only be a recording/streaming server. The best method for streaming to a number of recipients is to use a recording/streaming/web server where media can be encrypted and DoD compliant access control and auditing can be enforced via individual (unicast) viewer sessions with the server. IP multicast or broadcast should not be used. In the event IP multicast must be used, the media stream must be encrypted and a secure key exchange process employed. Full DoD compliant access control and auditing is required to gain access to the .sdp file that contains the information required to decrypt the stream. Encryption will prevent a streaming client that does not require the .sdp file from viewing the content after accessing the stream.

This may not be practical, particularly if the VTU is intended, or required, to receive un-scheduled incoming calls or is to be remotely managed and monitored in an un-scheduled manner. Receiving un-scheduled incoming calls that are automatically answered is, in itself, a vulnerability. This is an issue for IP and ISDN connected systems if auto-answer is on. The auto-answer feature is discussed later. Remote access and monitoring are also vulnerabilities due to the lack of strong access control mechanisms and the ease with which a VTU can be compromised if it is connected to an IP network. These vulnerabilities are discussed later. The point of this and the next requirement is to disable the capability of the VTU to “see and hear” information and activities located or occurring near the VTU when it is not actively participating in a call. While these vulnerabilities are of particular concern in an office or other work area, it may be of less concern in a conference room except if meetings occur in the facility that do not require the use of the VTC system.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;This can be deemed N/A or “Not a Finding” in the event there are validated, approved, and documented mission requirements; however, the VTU is still subject to RTS-VTC 1025.00.

Note: This finding can be reduced to a CAT III in the event the camera(s) can be remote controlled but are aimed at the wall (e.g., a corner) where it/they cannot see room activities if the camera supports aiming or being moved. While the practice of aiming the camera at the side or back wall of the room where there is nothing to see and muting the microphone can mitigate normal operational issues, this measure is not a mitigation if the camera can be remotely controlled via auto-answer and Far End Camera Control (FECC) and/or the CODEC remote control/configuration feature is not configured properly, is compromised, or can be accessed by a administrator with the remote access password.

Additionally, if a VTU is connected to an IP network, it may be capable of receiving incoming calls while active. When a VTU receives an incoming call; the normal operation is that a notification of the incoming call is provided both audibly and visually. The visual notification typically includes a display of the source of the call. This can be a phone number or IP address. This information should be accompanied by an identification of the caller. While the source information is typically available from the network, the identity of the calling party associated with that information is typically contained in a locally accessible directory. If the source information is in the directory, the associated identity information is located and added to the display or displayed by itself. This directory is typically on the VTU or can be on a locally associated management or directory server. Directories must therefore be kept up to date with user information related to other VTUs with which any given VTU is expected to communicate. Ideally, the full identity of the caller is sent from the calling system for display on the called system even if there is no local directory entry. 

Based upon the displayed information, the user of the VTU can make an informed decision and take appropriate action to answer the call, or not.

This would be akin to your speakerphone picking up a call each time the phone rang allowing an ongoing conversation to be heard by the caller. This feature, if activated, is highly detrimental to the confidentiality of information in a room in which a VTU is installed. In fact, a security incident could result from “auto-answer” being enabled. Such would be the case in the event a VTU automatically answered a call when a classified meeting or discussion (not via VTC) was being held in a conference room or an office having VTC capability. The auto-answer feature must not be activated by a user unless the feature is required to satisfy mission requirements. Furthermore, users must be trained in the vulnerabilities associated with the auto-answer feature and in its proper use if it is to be used.  The ideal mitigation for this vulnerability is for the auto-answer feature to not be supported by the VTU or there be an administrator setting that can disable the feature preventing a user from activating it. &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;NONE&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;The inadvertent disclosure of sensitive or classified information to a caller of a VTU that may not have an appropriate need-to-know or proper security clearance.&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;System Administrator&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Designated Approving Authority&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Other&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;DCBP-1, ECSC-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target VTC Endpoint Site/System/Enclave</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>VTC Endpoint Site/System/Enclave</dc:subject><dc:identifier>1418</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-17513r1_fix">[IP][ISDN]; Perform the following tasks:

This decision must also be based upon what information would be made available to the caller when call is answered. The information that would be placed at risk is what can be picked up in the physical area of the VTU or what is being carried by the conference in which it is participating. 

If the VTU is participating in a conference already, answering a call while in a conference would activate the VTU’s integrated MCU and join the caller to the conference. The possibility of an incoming call being automatically joined to a meeting in progress in this manner places the confidentiality of that meeting at risk. The caller could become a participant of a meeting to which they were not invited and subsequently receive sensitive or classified information for which the caller may or may not have a need-to-know or appropriate security clearance.

As with a VTU in standby mode, an “auto-answer” feature is of great concern during a VTC session. A VTU must be configured in such a way that it cannot automatically answer a call and join the call to an active session without some form of access control. Either user intervention or a properly managed “local meeting” password is required to join such an incoming call to an active session. In some instances the “do-not-disturb” feature may be used by the user to block such calls by returning a “busy” signal. The capability of joining a conference on a VTU using its integrated MCU through the use of a “local meeting” password must be used only when the VTU user needs to pre-schedule and host a multipoint conference on his/her VTU. This capability must not be available at all times. The VTU should have the capability to disable this kind of access when it is not needed. Local meeting passwords must be used one time and not repeated. This requirement is discussed later.

Ensure the following regarding incoming calls while the VTU is engaged in a conference: 

- The VTU automatically rejects incoming calls, is administratively configured to return a “busy signal”, or optionally does so through the use of a user selected “do-not-disturb” feature. 
OR 
- The VTU is configured to not automatically answer an incoming call and join it to an active conference (in progress) without user intervention. (i.e., the user must decide to answer the call or not based on the required source and caller information display. Answering the call affects the join).

Note: In the event the VTU supports the “call-in/join via local meeting password” feature for the integrated MCU, the VTU should also have an administrative setting that disables this capability thereby forcing host action. In effect this setting would invoke an automatic “do-not-disturb” or return of a “busy” signal while the VTU is active. 
The various VTC vendors implement VTU integrated MCU access control differently. 

Examples are as follows: 
Tandberg – Dial out and dial in with host action only – no local meeting password option. 
Polycom – Dial-out and Dial-in w/ “meeting password” which is required to join a multipoint call or streamed meeting. This is a memory location used to set the local MCU or streamed media access or join password for access to the VTU and to set the endpoint password given to another MCU when calling into it. “This field can also be used to store a password required by another system that this system calls.” 

Note: this pre-configurable “meeting password” violates unique and scripted password policies. 

Note: During APL testing, this is a finding in the event this requirement is not supported by the VTU as an administrator configurable option and/or as a default condition. The desired capability is to block incoming calls during a VTC session by default without requiring the user to set the condition since the user may forget to do so. The user may have the capability to set the condition that temporarily turns off the “do-not-disturb” feature such that the call can be answered externally to the conference and then manually joined.

Interview the IAO to determine if this requirement is covered in a SOP and user training/agreements. Interview a sampling of users to determine their awareness and implementation of the requirement. Place a call to an endpoint that is already in a conference and witness its response or reaction.

This can be by accessing the monitoring capabilities of a particular VTU via IP as discussed above, or using a capability of a centralized MCU, or an administrator or “operator/facilitator” can participate in a conference using a VTU. No matter how monitoring is being performed, participants in a call must be notified or be made aware that the call is being monitored by someone that is not a direct participant of the call or conference who therefore may not have a need-to-know regarding the conference information. This is a particular concern if the monitored conference contains classified information. If the monitoring is done by remotely accessing a VTU, typically, an automated notification is displayed on the VTU being monitored.

As security and conference confidentiality have become an IA concern, VTU vendors have standardized on DES and AES encryption standards for VTC media streams. H.235 has been developed to help to secure the signaling protocols used in the H.323 suite of protocols. Most VTC media traffic is considered to be sensitive information requiring protection. Minimally all endpoints and MCUs must employ FIPS-validated or NSA-approved cryptography for data in transit, including both media and signaling.

Much of the legacy VTC gear used today either supports DES or has no encryption. Newer CODECs support FIPS 140-2 encryption for media and signaling and typically have three encryption options on, off or automatic/negotiate. The preferred setting is ON and used when the other VTUs that a VTU needs to communicate with support encryption. Auto/negotiate is the preferred setting when this is not known.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;[ISDN] Reduce to CAT III for legacy ISDN/dialup MCUs or VTUs when these will not interoperate using native/internal encryption options.

Such echoing is done in what is called “clear text” in that you can read what was entered. This process is used for normal typing, but must be changed when entering passwords. When passwords are displayed (echoed) during logon, the risk of password compromise is increased and password confidentiality is greatly reduced. If the password is displayed during logon, it can easily be compromised through the use of a simple technique of shoulder surfing, i.e., a third party witnessing the logon could view the echoed password and remember it or write it down. This could also happen through surveillance methods. This presents a major vulnerability to the security or confidential nature of the password. To mitigate this, when entering a password, the characters that are echoed to the display must be something other than the clear text characters.

The minimum password length is 15 characters. The minimum password complexity when not using DoD PKI is at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one number, and one special character must be present in the password. When a password is changed, at least half the characters in the password must change; for a 15-character password this mandates eight positions, and for a four-digit PIN at least two numbers would change.

While videoconferencing endpoints typically do not require a username, they do require a password for user access and authentication. The strength of these passwords is an issue for video endpoints and is dependent upon the method of entry. Strong passwords, along with other measures noted in DoD policy, are required for any access method that is received by the video endpoint across a network. This is because of the potential that a password could be broken by a variety of high-speed cracking attacks. Due to the inability to use letters, PINs are very weak passwords. Typically, a local video endpoint PIN entered from a hand-held remote control can support five or more characters.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;Reduced to CAT III when a five-digit PIN is used for video endpoint local access from the hand-held remote control.

2. Local user call accounting code.
3. Local user access to user configurable settings.
4. Local user or machine access from the VTU to the user’s networked or otherwise attached PC running a presentation or desktop sharing application (or vice versa i.e., PC to VTU) (discussed later).

11. Local VTU access to gatekeeper services (automatically identifies the VTU to the gatekeeper).

The passwords or PINs used for various differing functions must be logically grouped and be unique among other passwords implemented on the system. For example, local user password/PINs such as those in items 1, 2, and 3 could be the same. These would be entered manually using the hand-held remote control. Another logical grouping might be items 10 and 11. The other functions are logically separate because they perform different functions and are used by different entities. One vendor uses a single password pre-configured in the VTU for functions 8 (bi-directionally), 9, 10 and possibly 11. This is a problem for two reasons. The first was stated above, it is used for different functions, and secondly, it is preprogrammed into the VTU. While a VTU can have an identity or password that identifies itself to another machine for passing control information, such a password cannot be used to provide user level access to information. The user must enter this password manually.

While requiring a user to authenticate to the video endpoint before it can be used to make or receive calls may detract from the video endpoint's “ease of use” and the “user experience” the capability should exist, be used where needed, and be configurable. Users should authenticate to activate the video endpoint for general use, make a call, or answer a call. Minimally, authentication should be a password unique to the user and recorded in session logs. Preferably, the video endpoint should support the use of DoD PKI for user authentication. To comply with DoD access control requirements for both users and administrators, a video endpoint should use a remote authentication server that can provide centralized management of passwords and accounts. This controls access to the videoconferencing system and limits the user’s privileges or authorizations. Many videoconferencing endpoints today do not provide sufficient identification, authorization, or auditing capabilities regarding their activation and use. While at least one vendor’s system can be configured to require the entry of a PIN to place a call, the feature is only a call accounting feature and not a security feature. While gatekeepers and gateways provide some access control, this control only relates to access to their services. They do not play a part in endpoint activation or use of the endpoint for point-to-point calls. 

The ITU developed H.235 as the security recommendation for H.323 and other H.245-based systems. H.323 provides for user identification rather than device identification, using simple passwords/PINs or DoD PKI. H.235 has the capability of negotiating encryption and key exchange. The use of H.350 can improve security by providing standardized management and storage of authentication credentials, as well as multilevel authorization. The use of H.245 and H.350 in combination could be the solution to the endpoint activation and user identification deficiency currently exhibited by videoconferencing endpoints. 

While it seems debatable whether a videoconferencing endpoint is, or should be, subject to DoD access control and auditing policies, particularly in unclassified environments, there are use cases where such compliance would be beneficial to the protection of DoD information. This is particularly in cases where a video endpoint is located in an area where classified materials, information, or discussions occur because an active video endpoint could generate a security incident. This issue could be more of a concern if the video endpoint was located in a classified work area while connected to an unclassified network or network having a lower classification than the work area. Compliance would also be beneficial for video endpoints in areas processing sensitive information. To protect the information, the video endpoint should remain dormant (even while powered on) and not capable of placing or answering a call unless it is activated by a user logging onto the system. &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;System Administrator&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Other&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target VTC Endpoint Site/System/Enclave</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>VTC Endpoint Site/System/Enclave</dc:subject><dc:identifier>1418</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-17588r2_fix">Configure the classified videoconferencing system to authenticate with a unique user logon prior to performing functions and services.

Once any meeting password is distributed to conferees, it is known by them. If a different and unique meeting password is not used for subsequent meetings, someone that has knowledge of (i.e., remembered or recorded) a previously used password could join a conference to which they were not invited to or in which they should not be included. This capability could violate requirements for access to information based on need-to-know and/or could lead to the disclosure of sensitive or classified information. 
     
While the setting of the “local meeting password” password could be an administrator function, most often it is set by the VTU user hosting the conference since the integrated MCU may be used in an ad hoc manner. Ideally, its use would be prescheduled. As noted above, the capability that uses this password should not be functional at all times.
     
Of additional concern is; in the event a local meeting password is not set on the VTU, the VTU might provide no access control to the services that use it. This cannot be permitted if the VTU performs in this manner. As such this issue must be mitigated by configuration of a “blocking” password that is kept confidential. 
     
An additional consideration when using a “meeting password” is that such passwords should be used one time only. Once a meeting password is distributed to conferees, it is known by them. If a different and unique meeting password is not used for subsequent meetings, someone that has knowledge of a previously used password could join a conference that they were not invited to or should not be included. This capability could violate access to information based on need-to-know which could lead to the disclosure of sensitive or classified information.

One of these measures is to set a one-time-use password for the streamed media. Another measure is to install configuration settings to limit the reach of the streamed media across the network to only those portions that are to receive it. This is done by setting the TTL as low as possible. A mitigation that can be used for the lack of access control for IP multicast is to use different multicast addresses and IP ports each time a streaming session is configured. First these should never be the default address(es) or ports used by the vendor’s system and they should be randomly selected.  

Note:  Streaming is a feature of the VTU that could be turned on and configured for monitoring purposes by an adversary if the administrative access to the VTU is compromised. This is another reason why it is imperative to change all access codes and passwords on the VTU as required earlier.

Typically, this involves connecting a PC workstation, on which the presentation is displayed and controlled, to a CODEC which distributes the presentation to the conferees. Care in operating this feature must be exercised so that the PC user does not inadvertently display information on their workstation that is not part of the conference and is not intended to be viewed by the conferees. Users must be aware that anything that they display on their PC workstation display while connected to the CODEC will be displayed on all of the conference monitors. This collaboration/display feature could result in the disclosure of sensitive or classified information to individuals that do not have a validated need-to-know or have the proper clearance to view the information. This is a problem when sharing a PC desktop via any collaboration tool using any connection method.

The first of the PC-CODEC interconnection methods, supported by most (but not all) CODECs, is the direct connection of the PC video output to an external video input on the CODEC. This method is most common interconnection method, is most secure, and is the recommended method for DoD. This is the only method available to users of VTUs connected to ISDN only (i.e., not connected to an IP network in addition to the ISDN lines).The second method for PC-CODEC interconnection for data/presentation sharing is to establish a virtual connection between the CODEC and PC workstation across an IP based LAN. While this method is implemented in different ways by different vendors, most if not all methods require the installation of an application or a utility on the PC workstation that is to share its data or display. While this method is convenient, since it does not require a cable connected to the CODEC, it presents varying degrees of vulnerability to the PC and the data it contains depending upon the particular application or utility installed. Additionally, the installation of such software is contrary to most DoD policy regarding approved workstation applications. All such software must be thoroughly evaluated and approved before installation.

Most vendors provide a proprietary application or utility that is loaded on the PC workstation to establish the virtual connection between the PC and CODEC. The main purpose and capability of this utility is to capture the PC’s display graphics and send it to the CODEC. Typically, these utilities require only the IP address of the CODEC. The CODEC may or may not require a password to accept this input. When reading the documentation on these utilities there is no indication that the media stream generated by these utilities is encrypted. This may or may not be an issue depending upon the protocols used by the utility. Sniffing the stream may or may not reveal the displayed information. One vendor provides a utility to upload MS PowerPoint files to the CODEC and display them using an embedded viewer. This same vendor provides another utility to integrate with MS NetMeeting on the PC and stream content from there using T.120 protocol. 

An additional feature of some of these utilities is the capability of conferees to share and work on files across the connection between CODECs. This feature brings a larger set of collaboration tool features to the VTC arena. 

At least one vendor’s virtual connection method requires the installation of PC remote control desktop sharing software on the PC. Once the remote control/access server application is running, anybody with the matching or compatible viewer/control application and the access password can connect to the PC workstation from another PC workstation. This provides full control of its resources and access to all of its files since this is the purpose of this type of application. This type of application can receive remote keyboard and mouse inputs as if the user was sitting at the PC itself controlling it. As such this method is capable of much more than capturing the graphics displayed on the PC monitor and sending it to a CODEC. As such an adversary could gain full control of the PC workstation at any time when the server application is running, whether there is a conference being displayed or not. Many such server applications are started as a service when the workstation is booted. This means that the connection is available to an adversary any time the PC is running. This is a huge vulnerability for the PC workstation. 
As such, the use of virtual connection methods must first be approved by the DAA and must be tightly controlled. 

Another issue that must be addressed is the access control between the VTU and the PC. This discussion and/or requirements are dependent upon the direction of the access. (i.e., PC to VTU or VTU to PC) Access to a PC (from a VTU), by policy, requires a strong policy compliant password (and other measures, supported or not). Such a password cannot be entered from a VTU remote control unless an on screen keyboard (or cell phone text entry requiring password display) is used thus opening the password to shoulder surfing or being viewed by a conference room full of people (discussed earlier). If the VTU is to initiate the connection to the PC, it is best to store a strong password on the VTU that will identify the VTU to the PC sharing application. The sharing application is only run when needed when the PC is required to interface with the VTU; it is not run as a service that is constantly available. Other constraints could apply. The recommended alternative is to initiate all VTU - PC connections from the PC and implementing the appropriate access control in the VTU in compliance with password policy if a virtual connection is to be used. Better yet, use a direct connection using a video out connection on the PC.  

Furthermore, it is recommended that, if the remote control/access method is used, a PC workstation be dedicated to the purpose of displaying presentations on the CODEC. No other information should be placed on this PC. The PC should be turned off or disconnected from the LAN when a presentation is not being displayed to a conference. In this way, the installation of the remote control/access software will not place non conference information at risk.

While there are systems and methods for extending the control signals from the hand-held remote control to the CODEC, many times the CODEC is connected to an AV control panel (typically called a “touch panel”) that sits on the conference table or possibly a podium. While this panel can be connected to the CODEC wirelessly (as discussed later) or via a wired IP connection, typically the connection is via an EIA-232 serial connection on the CODEC. To give the “touch panel” the ability to control the CODEC, the CODEC contains an API control program. All functions that are available on the hand-held remote control are typically duplicated on the “touch panel”

Typically a VTC CODEC’s API provides full access to all configuration settings and control commands supported but the CODEC. This can be a big problem if the command channel is compromised because this would give the attacker the ability to reconfigure the CODEC or its features and capabilities and not just control them. To mitigate this problem, the CODEC’s API must provide a separation of the commands that control the system from the commands related to user and administrator configuration settings. If a password/PIN is implemented for user settings as required above, the touch panel must support the manual entry of the user configuration password/PIN assuming they will need to be accessed via the touch panel. Similarly, administrator settings should not be accessible from the touch panel or the interface on the CODEC that it uses without the use of an administrator password/PIN. &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;System Administrator&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target VTC Endpoint Site/System/Enclave</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>VTC Endpoint Site/System/Enclave</dc:subject><dc:identifier>1418</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-17596r2_fix">Implement only CODEC's with a local API preventing unrestricted access to user or administrator configuration settings and CODEC controls without a password.</fixtext><fix id="F-17596r2_fix" /><check system="C-18969r2_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_VTC_Policy.xml" /><check-content>Review site documentation to confirm a CODEC’s API does not provide unrestricted access to user or administrator configuration settings and without the use of an appropriate password.

Best practice and DoD policy dictates that authenticators are to be protected. This includes user account names, passwords, PINs, access codes, etc. The primary method used to protect these bits of information is encryption in transit for both the username and the password, and encryption of passwords in storage. It has been found that some VTC endpoint vendors do not provide this protection for passwords in storage, or at least, have not in the past.

The first such vulnerability to be aware of is one where the administrator password can be obtained across the network by requesting certain files from the CODEC using a web browser. Once the file is accessed, the admin password is displayed in the clear within the source code for the page.

The second such vulnerability to be aware of is one where, in one vendor’s product line, the user access codes are stored in a clear text file that is uploaded to the CODEC. This file is accessible from the FTP server on the CODEC. Access is, however, protected by the remote access password. One can only assume the vendor does not value these access codes as an IA measure since the discussion of their use relates to call accounting.

Vulnerabilities like these and other issues are typically addressed by vendors like most issues are addressed, via patches to software, firmware upgrades, and major new releases of code. As such, it is good practice and a widely used DoD requirement that DoD systems should be running the latest version of software and install all patches to mitigate IA issues.

These include VTC endpoint and MCU managers, gatekeeper, gateway, and scheduling software. Gateways, gatekeepers, and scheduling systems are discussed later in this document.
     
The advantage of implementing a management system for the management of VTC endpoints is that all endpoints can be managed from a central location and their configuration can be standardized. This is a good thing in that configuration changes made on any given endpoint for temporary purposes can be discovered and corrected easily. 
     
The disadvantage is that their use makes all managed VTC endpoints vulnerable and at risk of compromise if the management system is compromised. 
     
While compliance with all applicable STIGs is covered in the next subsection, additional guidance may be provided in a future release of this or a related document.
     
Typically, VTC vendors provide their management applications and other infrastructure products on appliances with embedded operating systems (modified/scaled down, general purpose, or proprietary) and other application and database code (proprietary or otherwise). Some of these applications may be provided to run on a general purpose platform. 
     
In general, to mitigate risks, all VTC system management applications and application suites, including endpoint and MCU managers, gateways, gatekeepers, and scheduling systems must be operated on secure or hardened platforms and comply with all applicable DoD STIGs with specific emphasis on user accounts, roles/permissions, access control, and auditing.

This has the effect of providing confidentiality for the workgroup traffic by limiting the ability of users in other workgroups to see and access the traffic during normal operations. It also enhances the ability to control traffic flows for, and access to, LAN services. Another benefit of using VLANs is that they can improve network performance if they are properly pruned. Typically, when a VLAN is configured on one LAN switch, the other switches in the network will “learn” that VLAN, thus it will propagate throughout the network. This property is not what enhances network performance since it allows broadcast traffic in the VLAN to traverse the entire network. Also, if the number of allowable VLANs that a switch has configured or learns is exceeded, the LAN can become unstable. VLAN pruning eliminates this problem and is actually what can enhance network performance by limiting the traffic that devices in the LAN must process.

The use of a separate IP address space and properly pruned separate VLANs for VTC systems will have the following effects:
 - Enhance the confidentiality of unencrypted VTC traffic.
 - Enhance the confidentiality of the VTC device management traffic, particularly if secure protocols are not available for use.
 - Limit the ability of LAN users to see the VTC devices in other VLANs, which limits the possibility of compromise from user or machine induced malicious activity.

Some VTC systems should be protected using other VLAN structures as follows:
 - Primary conference room systems should have their own closely pruned VLAN and IP subnet. This could be a single conference room or several conference rooms if they are required to communicate with each other or are part of an overall managed VTC network within the enclave. This will provide the maximum protection from compromise for the conference room systems.
 - Hardware-based desktop and office VTUs should be grouped into their own VLAN and IP subnet. This could be the same VLAN and subnet as the one used for conference rooms if these devices are to communicate with them or if they are part of an overall managed VTC network within the enclave.
 - Hardware-based desktop and office VTUs that integrate and signal with the site’s VoIP telephone system may be grouped separately or utilize the Voice system VLAN structure and IP subnet.
 - PC-based soft-VTUs are to be implemented or segregated/controlled as described in the related document covering softphones and soft-VTUs.
 - Local MCUs and VTU management stations must reside in the VTC VLAN and IP subnet with the devices they manage or conference.

Typically, one would expect a configuration setting that says something like “Disable Wireless” that would disable any onboard wireless capability whether integrated or reliant on a plug-in card. The Wireless STIG in WIR0167 requires all wireless LAN NICs to be turned-off by default after system boot-up or whenever a wireless network connection is not required. Additionally WIR0130 requires that the NIC have the capability to disable ad hoc connectivity. While these requirements are addressed toward PCs and PEDs, they are applicable to VTC endpoints.  Support for these requirements does not seem to be available with at least some VTC endpoint’s PCMCIA wireless LAN card implementations. It is conceivable that a WLAN card could be inserted into the PCMCIA slot and activated with basic default settings and no security.

Attendees and endpoints must be authorized or registered in advance. This way the conference organizers can control who has access to sensitive or classified information based upon validated clearance and need-to-know. Unrestricted access or the use of a meeting password that is reused or well-known can lead to a security incident where information is improperly disclosed to unauthorized individuals not having appropriate clearance or need-to-know. Additionally, if call-in access is supported and approved, a one-time use meeting password is required. 

H.323 gatekeepers provide access control for VTC network infrastructure devices such as MCUs and gateways to VTC endpoints. Using H.225 an endpoint can discover a gatekeeper and register with it. The endpoint is identified by the gatekeeper by a “gatekeeper password” which is essentially the endpoint ID. The gatekeeper provides address translation and bandwidth management. Once registered with the gatekeeper an endpoint must ask permission of the gatekeeper to make a call. If the available VTC bandwidth is used or limited, the gatekeeper can reject the request or negotiate a lower bandwidth. This acts as part of the access control mechanism for the MCU and works in combination with a scheduling application. The rest of the MCU access control equation is pre-registration of the endpoint IDs when scheduling a conference. Pre-registration of endpoint IDs for specific conferences is required because there are typically no meeting passwords and the phone numbers or IP addresses of the MCU ports don’t change between sessions. Additionally (and here’s the issue mentioned above) people are not authenticated only endpoints are. The endpoint ID is critical in this access control process. The endpoint ID is entered (pre-configured) in the system for a specific scheduled conference. The system only permits the endpoint to access the MCU during the scheduled time of the conference. 

This discussion also applies to ad hoc conferences and “standing” conferences. A standing conference is one where MCU facilities are dedicated to a conference that is operational all of the time or one that is regularly scheduled to be operational for certain time periods. The implementation of a standing conference permits conferees to join the conference at will or as needed to discuss a current topic or mission. Standing conferences are implemented for many reasons. Standing conferences are more vulnerable to compromise than one time scheduled events. Extra care must be exercised regarding access control to these conferences. &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;System Administrator&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Other&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target VTC Endpoint Site/System/Enclave</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>VTC Endpoint Site/System/Enclave</dc:subject><dc:identifier>1418</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-17616r2_fix">Implement access control measures for all conferences hosted on a centralized MCU appliance as follows:

If the VTU only connects with one other endpoint CODEC or MCU, this port opening can be limited to the IP address of the other end. While a hole has been opened in the firewall, the risk is somewhat mitigated by the address restriction. However, if a VTC call can come from any endpoint, with any IP address, then the hole resulting from opening the UDP ports to a large range of IP addresses negates the effectiveness of the firewall. To mitigate this issue, an H.460 border controller is required rather than opening all UDP ports to all or many IP addresses. This device effectively limits all of the UDP and TCP ports required to support H.323 VTC sessions to a very small number (3-7), the connections through which are initiated from within the enclave thus requiring little or no firewall reconfiguration to accommodate.

H.460 is a set of extensions to the ITU H.323 standard that includes methods to traverse firewalls.  In order for a video conference to take place across a secure firewall using H.460, a server or appliance using H.460 must be available and reachable by video conferencing endpoints. Video conference endpoints need to register with an H.460 server and in order to do this they must be enabled for this by their respective manufacturers.

This requirement results in a CAT III finding in the event this requirement cannot be met and IP ports are statically opened on a standard firewall to accommodate VTC traffic such that the IP ports are restricted by the internal IP address(es) of the internal CODEC(s) and the external address(es) of a central MCU or a limited set of remote endpoints using an any-any statement.  This CAT III can be eliminated in the event these ports are not statically opened, but are manually opened and closed by the firewall administrator for the duration of VTC sessions. This CAT III can also be eliminated in the event the inbound permit statements are restricted to a limited range of UDP ports and external IP addresses, while routing/outbound permit statements forces all outbound VTC traffic to these external addresses.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;This can be downgraded from a CAT I to a CAT III if this requirement cannot be met and IP ports are statically opened on a standard firewall to accommodate VTC traffic such that the IP ports are restricted by the internal IP address(es) of the internal CODEC(s) and the external address(es) of a central MCU or a limited set of remote endpoints using an any-any statement.
