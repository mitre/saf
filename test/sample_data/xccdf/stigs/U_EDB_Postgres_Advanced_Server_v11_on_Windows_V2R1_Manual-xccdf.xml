Unlimited concurrent connections to the DBMS could allow a successful Denial of Service (DoS) attack by exhausting connection resources; a system can also fail or be degraded by an overload of legitimate users. Limiting the number of concurrent sessions per user is helpful in reducing these risks.

This requirement addresses concurrent session control for a single account. It does not address concurrent sessions by a single user via multiple system accounts and it does not deal with the total number of sessions across all accounts.

The capability to limit the number of concurrent sessions per user must be configured in, or added to, the DBMS (for example, by use of a logon trigger), when this is technically feasible. 
Note: it is not sufficient to limit sessions via a web server or application server alone, because legitimate users and adversaries can potentially connect to the DBMS by other means.

The organization will need to define the maximum number of concurrent sessions by account type, by account, or a combination thereof. In deciding on the appropriate number, it is important to consider the work requirements of the various types of users. For example, two might be an acceptable limit for general users accessing the database via an application; but ten might be too few for a database administrator using a database management GUI tool, where each query tab and navigation pane may count as a separate session.

(Sessions may also be referred to as connections or logons, which for the purposes of this requirement are synonyms.)

Note that by default if no connection limit is specified, when a Postgres database user is created it will be allowed to have an unlimited number of concurrent sessions. The EDB Postgres CREATE USER and the PostgreSQL CREATE ROLE sql commands, which are used to create database users, provide a CONNECTION LIMIT option for configuring the allowable number of concurrent sessions for a user. It is good administrative practice to use this option to set the connection limit when new users are created. However, if a user was created without a connection limit or if the assigned connection limit needs to be changed, the CONNECTION LIMIT option can be set using the ALTER USER and ALTER ROLE commands.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target EDB Postgres Advanced Server v11 on Windows</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>EDB Postgres Advanced Server v11 on Windows</dc:subject><dc:identifier>4107</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">SV-109391</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">V-100287</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-000054</ident><fixtext fixref="F-25791r495411_fix">Execute the following SQL as enterprisedb:

A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential oversight or other error. Managing accounts for the same person in multiple places is inefficient and prone to problems with consistency and synchronization.

A comprehensive application account management process that includes automation helps to ensure that accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed.

Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended, or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores, such as multiple servers. Account management functions can also include: assignment of group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephone notification to report atypical system account usage.

The EDB Postgres Advanced Server must be configured to automatically utilize organization-level account management functions, and these functions must immediately enforce the organization's current account policy.

Automation may be comprised of differing technologies that when placed together contain an overall mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target EDB Postgres Advanced Server v11 on Windows</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>EDB Postgres Advanced Server v11 on Windows</dc:subject><dc:identifier>4107</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">SV-109393</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">V-100289</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-000015</ident><fixtext fixref="F-25792r495414_fix">Identify any user using "trust", "sha-256-scram", md5", "ident", "peer" or "password" as allowable access methods.

To identify users in the pg_hba.conf file using the methods listed above, open the pg_hba.conf file in a text editor, and inspect the contents of the file, looking for uncommented lines with these methods. Optionally, the following command can be run from a Windows command prompt to identify any uncommented lines in the pg_hba.conf file that may be using these methods: 

 type &lt;postgresql pg_hba.conf directory&gt;\pg_hba.conf | findstr /N "scram-sha-256 md5 trust password peer ident" | find /V /N "#"

Note: If the path to the pg_hba.conf file contains spaces in it, the path to the file (including the file name) should be placed in double quotes.

Document any rows that have "trust", "sha-256-scram", "md5", "ident", "peer”, or "password" specified for the "METHOD" column and obtain appropriate approval for each user specified in the "USER" column (i.e., all DBMS managed accounts).

For any users not documented and approved as DBMS managed accounts, change the "METHOD" column to one of the externally managed (not "trust", "sha-256-scram", "md5", "ident", "peer" or "password") options defined here:

 Verify none of the uncommented entries in the pg_hba.conf include: "trust", "sha-256-scram", "md5", "ident", "peer”, or "password" as allowable access methods.
Verify options are set to the correct values for the specific environment.

Note: The default location for the pg_hba.conf file is in the postgresql data directory. The location of the pg_hba.conf file for a running postgres instance can be found using the following command run from a Windows command prompt:

 psql -d &lt;database name&gt; -U &lt;database superuser name&gt; -c "SHOW hba_file"

where, &lt;database name&gt; is any database in the EDB postgres instance and &lt;database superuser name&gt; is a database superuser. By default, a database named "edb" and a superuser named "enterprisedb" are installed with EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS).

To verify the pg_hba.conf file is not using the access methods listed above, open the pg_hba.conf file in a text editor and inspect the contents of the file, looking for uncommented lines with these methods. Optionally, the following command can be run from a Windows command prompt to identify any uncommented lines in the pg_hba.conf file that may be using these methods: 

 type &lt;postgresql pg_hba.conf directory&gt;\pg_hba.conf | findstr /N "scram-sha-256 md5 trust password peer ident" | find /V /N "#"

If any uncommented lines are identified, verify that the users are documented as being authorized to use one of these access methods.

If the users are not authorized to use these access methods, this is a finding.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-224132"><title>SRG-APP-000033-DB-000084</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-224132r508023_rule" weight="10.0" severity="medium"><version>EP11-00-000800</version><title>The EDB Postgres Advanced Server must enforce approved authorizations for logical access to information and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Authentication with a DoD-approved PKI certificate does not necessarily imply authorization to access the DBMS. To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DoD-approved PKIs, all DoD systems, including databases, must be properly configured to implement access control policies.

Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement.

Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system.

If this documentation is missing, this is a finding.

Review the permissions actually in place for the EDB postgres cluster (i.e., instance).

First check the privileges of all users and roles in the database by running the following command from the Windows command prompt:

 psql -d &lt;database name&gt; -U &lt;database superuser name&gt; -c "\du"

where, &lt;database name&gt; is any database in the EDB postgres instance and &lt;database superuser name&gt; is a database superuser. By default, a database named "edb" and a superuser named "enterprisedb" are installed with EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS).

If any users or roles have privileges that exceed those that are documented, this is a finding.

Next check the privileges that have been granted on the tables, views, and sequences in the database by running the following command from the Windows command prompt for each database in the EDB postgres instance:

 psql -d &lt;database name&gt; -U &lt;database superuser name&gt; -c "\dp"

If the privileges assigned to these objects for any users or roles exceeds those that have been documented, this is a finding.

Next as a user that has permission to view the contents of the pg_hba.conf file, review the authentication settings that are configured in that file.

Note that the default location for the pg_hba.conf file is in the postgresql data directory. The location of the pg_hba.conf file for a running EDB postgres instance can be found using the following command run from a Windows command prompt:

 psql -d &lt;database name&gt; -U &lt;database superuser name&gt; -c "SHOW hba_file"

where, &lt;database name&gt; is any database in the EDB postgres instance and &lt;database superuser name&gt; is a database superuser. By default, a database named "edb" and a superuser named "enterprisedb" are installed with EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS).

If any entries do not match the documented authentication requirements, this is a finding.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-224133"><title>SRG-APP-000080-DB-000063</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-224133r508023_rule" weight="10.0" severity="medium"><version>EP11-00-000900</version><title>The EDB Postgres Advanced Server must protect against a user falsely repudiating by ensuring all accounts are individual, unique, and not shared.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Non-repudiation of actions taken is required in order to maintain data integrity.

Audit records can be generated from various components within the DBMS (e.g., process, module). Certain specific application functionalities may be audited as well. The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is capable of generating audit records.

DoD has defined the list of events for which the DBMS will provide an audit record generation capability as the following:

(i) Successful and unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete privileges, security objects, security levels, or categories of information (e.g., classification levels);

(ii) Access actions, such as successful and unsuccessful logon attempts, privileged activities, or other system-level access, starting and ending time for user access to the system, concurrent logons from different workstations, successful and unsuccessful accesses to objects, all program initiations, and all direct access to the information system; and

1) Postgresql Data Directory Ownership and Permissions:
If the postgresql data directory and its contents are owned by unauthorized users, change ownership to an authorized user.

Restrict access on the postgresql data directory to the database service account, software owner accounts, Administrators, DBAs, System group, or other documented users authorized to start a postgresql database cluster.

2) Postgresql Configuration File Ownership and Permissions:

Restrict write access on Postgres configuration file(s) the database service account, software owner accounts, Administrators, DBAs, System group, or other documented users authorized to edit the file(s).

3) Database Users Assigned Superuser Privileges:
Remove superuser rights from unauthorized database users via the ALTER ROLE or ALTER USER SQL command.

The syntax is:
ALTER ROLE &lt;role&gt; NOSUPERUSER

or

ALTER USER &lt;user&gt; NOSUPERUSER

Example: 
ALTER ROLE testuser NOSUPERUSER;

OR 

ALTER USER testuser NOSUPERUSER;

If designated personnel are not able to configure auditable events, this is a finding.

If EDB Audit is being used, the EDB Audit settings may only be configured by Operating System users authorized to edit the cluster's postgresql.conf file or by database superusers. As such, the permissions associated with the postgresql.conf file must be checked as well as the database roles assigned to database users. In addition, database parameters, including the EDB Audit settings, may be specified via server startup command options. Users assigned "Modify" permission or greater on the postgresql data directory and its contents will be able to start the postgres database cluster. Therefore, only authorized users should be assigned these permissions.

1) Check Postgresql Data Directory Ownership and Permissions:
First, determine ownership of the postgresql data directory folder. This can be done using Windows Explorer or via a Windows command prompt.

Note: The default location for the EDB postgresql data directory is found in the directory where EDB Postgres Advanced Server is installed. The location of the data directory for a running postgres instance can be found using the following command run from a Windows command prompt:

 psql -d &lt;database name&gt; -U &lt;database superuser name&gt; -c "SHOW data_directory"

where, &lt;database name&gt; is any database in the EDB postgres instance and &lt;database superuser name&gt; is a database superuser. By default, a database named "edb" and a superuser named "enterprisedb" are installed with EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS).

Using Windows Explorer:
Browse to the directory where the postgresql data directory folder is located.
Select and right-click on the folder, select "Properties", select the "Security" tab, and select the "Advanced" button. 
Note the Value of the Owner field.

Using the Windows command prompt, enter the following command:

 dir "&lt;postgresql data directory&gt;" /Q /S

Note: The above command will list all of the files and folders under the data directory. To make the output of this command easier to review, it may be redirected to a text file.

Review the system security documentation. If the owner listed for the folder and any of the files and subfolders in the data directory is not authorized to own the folder and its content, this is a finding.

Next, check the permissions assigned to the postgresql data directory folder and its content. Again, this can be done using Windows Explorer or via a Windows command prompt.

Using Windows Explorer:
Browse to the directory where the postgresql data directory folder is located.
Select and right-click on the folder, select "Properties", and select the "Security" tab.
Review the users and groups and permissions assigned to them for the folder.

Using a Windows command prompt, the following command may be used to list file permissions:

 icacls "&lt;postgresql data directory&gt;"
 icacls "&lt;postgresql data directory&gt;\*" 
 Review the users and groups and permissions assigned to them for the file(s).
Note: The above commands will list the permissions for all files and folders under the data directory. To make the output of this command easier to review, it may be redirected to a text file.

Review the system security documentation.
If permissions are granted to Everyone or to the Users group, this is a finding.
If any account other than the database service account, software owner accounts, Administrators, DBAs, System group, or other documented users authorized to start a postgresql database cluster are listed, this is a finding.

2) Check Postgresql Configuration File Ownership and Permissions:
First, determine ownership of the postresql.conf file(s). This can be done using Windows Explorer or via a Windows command prompt.

Note that the default location for the postgresql.conf file is in the postgresql data directory. The location of the postgresql.conf file for a running postgres instance can be found using the following command run from a Windows command prompt:

 psql -d &lt;database name&gt; -U &lt;database superuser name&gt; -c "SHOW config_file"

Using Windows Explorer:
 Browse to the directory where the postgresql.conf file is located.
 Select and right-click on the postgresql.conf file, select "Properties", and select the "Details" tab. 
 Note the Value of the Owner field.

Using the Windows command prompt, enter the following command:

 dir "&lt;directory where postgresql.conf is located&gt;\postgresql*.conf" /Q

Review the system security documentation. If the owner listed for the file(s) is not authorized to own the file(s) this is a finding.

Next, check the permissions assigned to the postgresql configuration files. This can be done using Windows Explorer or via a Windows command prompt.

Using Windows Explorer:
 Browse to the directory where the postgresql.conf file is located.
 Select and right-click on the postgresql.conf file, select "Properties", and select the "Security" tab.
 Review the users and groups and permissions assigned to them for the file.

Using a Windows command prompt, the following command may be used to list file permissions:

 icacls "&lt;directory where postgresql.conf is located&gt;\postgresql*.conf"

 Review the users and groups and permissions assigned to them for the file(s).

Review the system security documentation.
If permissions are granted to Everyone or to the Users group, this is a finding.
If any account other than the database service account, software owner accounts, Administrators, DBAs, System group, or other documented users authorized to make changes to the configuration parameters of this database are listed, this is a finding.

Note: Since the postgresql.conf file may utilize include and include_dir statements to include additional parameter organizational specified configuration files, review the contents of the postgresql.conf file to determine if any uncommented include or include_dir statements are specified in the file. If these statements are found, the file ownership and permissions assigned to the files specified by these statements should also be checked. If any unauthorized users are owners of the files or have permission to edit the files this is a finding.

3) Check Database Users Assigned Superuser Privileges:
Use psql to connect to the db as enterprisedb and run this command:

 \du

If any unauthorized users/roles are listed as a superuser, this is a finding.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-224136"><title>SRG-APP-000091-DB-000066</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-224136r557457_rule" weight="10.0" severity="medium"><version>EP11-00-001200</version><title>The EDB Postgres Advanced Server must generate audit records for DoD-defined auditable events.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;The EDB Postgres Advanced Server must generate audit records for DoD-defined auditable events within all DBMS/database components.
  
Audit records should contain (at a minimum):
-Time stamps to establish when the events occurred
-Sufficient information to establish what type of events occurred
-Sufficient information to establish where the events occurred
-Sufficient information to establish the sources (origins) of the events
-Sufficient information to establish the outcome (success or failure) of the events
-Sufficient information to establish the identity of any user/subject or process associated with the event

Audit record content which may be necessary to investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one. Audit policy includes, for example, time stamps, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, filenames involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked.

In order to compile an accurate risk assessment and provide forensic analysis, it is essential for security personnel to know where events occurred, such as application components, modules, session identifiers, filenames, host names, and functionality.

The list of minimum DoD-defined audit events includes:
-When privileges/permissions are retrieved, added, modified or deleted
-When unsuccessful attempts to retrieve, add, modify, delete privileges/permissions occur
-Enforcement of access restrictions associated with changes to the configuration of the database(s)
-When security objects are accessed, modified, or deleted

Reconstruction of harmful events or forensic analysis is not possible if audit records do not contain enough information. To support analysis, some types of events will need information to be logged that exceeds the basic requirements of event type, time stamps, location, source, outcome, and user identity. If additional information is not available, it could negatively impact forensic investigations into user actions or other malicious events.

The organization must determine what additional information is required for complete analysis of the audited events. The additional information required is dependent on the type of information (e.g., sensitivity of the data and the environment within which it resides). At a minimum, the organization must employ either full-text recording of privileged commands or the individual identities of group users, or both. The organization must maintain audit trails in sufficient detail to reconstruct events to determine the cause and impact of compromise.

Examples of detailed information the organization may require in audit records are full-text recording of privileged commands or the individual identities of group account users.

In EnterpriseDB Postgres Plus Advanced Server, the edb_audit_tag can be used to record additional information.

Responses to audit failure depend upon the nature of the failure mode.

When availability is an overriding concern, approved actions in response to an audit failure are as follows:

(i) If the failure was caused by the lack of audit record storage capacity, the DBMS must continue generating audit records, if possible (automatically restarting the audit service if necessary), and overwriting the oldest audit records in a first-in-first-out manner.

(ii) If audit records are sent to a centralized collection server and communication with this server is lost or the server fails, the DBMS must queue audit records locally until communication is restored or until the audit records are retrieved manually.

If the organization does not employ an existing log management utility, the following example identifies one approach that may be followed to rotate EDB audit log files on Windows. 

Determine the maximum size of the audit log directory. For this example fix, assume the audit log directory must have a maximum size of 100MB. Divide the maximum size of the directory by 10 to determine the size of the log files for rotation. For this example, the audit log file size will be set to 10Mb. Perform the following steps to ensure that the audit log directory is never more than 90% full and the oldest logs are removed to make room for new logs:

1) Execute the following SQL statements to review current auditing related settings and to configure EPAS to generate a new audit log file when the current log file has reached the log file size determined above (10 Mb):

 -- List current EDB Audit settings
 SELECT name, setting FROM pg_settings WHERE category LIKE 'EnterpriseDB Audit%' ORDER BY name;

 /*
 * Note: If edb_audit is not set to 'csv' or 'xml', auditing is not enabled.
 * To enable EDB auditing, issue one of the following SQL statements:
 *
 * ALTER SYSTEM SET edb_audit TO 'xml';
 * 
 * or
 *
 * ALTER SYSTEM SET edb_audit TO 'csv';
 *
 */

 -- Set edb_audit_filename parameter to ensure unique name for each log file that is generated
 ALTER SYSTEM SET edb_audit_filename TO 'audit-%Y%m%d_%H%M%S';

 -- Set edb_audit_rotation_size to desired maximum file size (e.g., 10 Mb)
 ALTER SYSTEM SET edb_audit_rotation_size TO 10;

 -- Reload configuration settings to put the updated settings into effect
 SELECT pg_reload_conf();

 -- List current EDB Audit settings to confirm updates are in place
 SELECT name, setting FROM pg_settings WHERE category LIKE 'EnterpriseDB Audit%' ORDER BY name;

2) Using a text editor, create a Windows batch file with the following content:

 @ECHO OFF
 SETLOCAL
 SET "targetdir=&lt;Path to edb_audit Directory&gt;"
 SET /a retain=8

 FOR /f "skip=%retain%delims=" %%a IN (
 'dir /b /a-d /o-d "%targetdir%\audit-????????_??????.xml" '
 ) DO DEL "%targetdir%\%%a"

 GOTO :EOF

3) Replace "&lt;Path to edb_audit Directory&gt;" for "targetdir" variable in the batch file (3rd line) to correspond to the EDB audit log directory configured for your EPAS instance. Note that the EDB audit log directory is configured by the edb_audit_directory parameter. By default, the edb_audit_directory is set to "edb_audit", which results in an "edb_audit" directory being created under the EPAS cluster's data directory for audit logs if auditing is enabled. The location of the data directory for a running postgres instance can be found using the following command run from a Windows command prompt:

 psql -d &lt;database name&gt; -U &lt;database superuser name&gt; -c "SHOW data_directory"

where, &lt;database name&gt; is any database in the EDB postgres instance and &lt;database superuser name&gt; is a database superuser. By default, a database named "edb" and a superuser named "enterprisedb" are installed with EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS).

If default setting of "edb_audit" is used for the edb_audit_directory parameter, the path to the EDB audit directory would be &lt;EDB Postgres data directory&gt;\edb_audit.

4) Update the "retain" variable in the batch file (4th line) to correspond to the desired minimum number of audit log files that should be retained in the directory. It should be set so that sufficient headroom is maintained in the directory for log files generated between runs of the batch file.

5) Save the batch file to a location that would be accessible to the Windows Task Scheduler. For this example, save the file to "C:\Windows\System32\Manage_EDB_Audit_Logs.bat".

6) Using the Windows Task Scheduler, create a scheduled task to execute the Manage_EDB_Audit_Logs.bat file on a periodic basis. At a minimum, it is recommended that the task be scheduled to perform this action at least on an hourly basis. Depending on the various audit log settings and database activity, it may be necessary to configure the task to be run more frequently.</fixtext><fix id="F-25808r495462_fix" /><check system="C-25820r495461_chk"><check-content-ref href="EDB_Postgres_Advanced_Server_v11_on_Windows_STIG.xml" name="M" /><check-content>If the system documentation indicates audit trail completeness takes precedence over availability this is not applicable (NA).

In addition, access to audit records provides information an attacker could potentially use to his or her advantage.

To ensure the veracity of audit data, the information system and/or the application must protect audit information from any and all unauthorized access. This includes read, write, copy, etc.

This requirement can be achieved through multiple methods which will depend upon system architecture and design. Some commonly employed methods include ensuring log files enjoy the proper file system permissions utilizing file system protections and limiting log data location.

Additionally, applications with user interfaces to audit records should not allow for the unfettered manipulation of or access to those records via the application.

 psql -d &lt;database name&gt; -U &lt;database superuser name&gt; -c "SHOW edb_audit_directory"

where, &lt;database name&gt; is any database in the EDB postgres instance and &lt;database superuser name&gt; is a database superuser. By default, a database named "edb" and a superuser named "enterprisedb" are installed with EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS). 

Note that the default location for the EDB postgresql data directory is found in the directory where EDB Postgres Advanced Server is installed. The location of the data directory for a running postgres instance can be found using the following command run from a Windows command prompt:

 psql -d &lt;database name&gt; -U &lt;database superuser name&gt; -c "SHOW data_directory"

where, &lt;database name&gt; is any database in the EDB postgres instance and &lt;database superuser name&gt; is a database superuser. By default, a database named "edb" and a superuser named "enterprisedb" are installed with EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS).

If the default path is used for the postgresql data directory and the default setting of "edb_audit" is used for the edb_audit_directory parameter, the path to the EDB audit directory would be &lt;EDB Postgres data directory&gt;\edb_audit. Depending on the version of EPAS that is installed, the options that were selected during installation, and the edb_audit_directory parameter setting, the path to the data directory and the EDB audit directory may be different.

First, determine ownership of the EDB audit directory folder. This can be done using Windows Explorer or via a Windows command prompt.

Using Windows Explorer:
 Browse to the directory where the EDB audit directory folder is located.
 Select and right-click on the folder, select "Properties", select the "Security" tab, and select the "Advanced" button. 
 Note the Value of the Owner field.

Using the Windows command prompt, enter the following command, replacing &lt;EDB Audit directory&gt; with the correct path for the EDB audit directory:

 dir "&lt;EDB Audit directory&gt;" /Q /S

 Note: The above command will list all of the files and folders under the audit directory. To make the output of this command easier to review, it may be redirected to a text file.

Review the system security documentation. If the owner listed for the folder and any of the files and subfolders in the EDB audit directory and its content is not the service account responsible for running the Advanced Server database service this is a finding. 

Next, check the permissions assigned to the EDB audit directory folder and its content. Again, this can be done using Windows Explorer or via a Windows command prompt.

Using Windows Explorer:
 Browse to the directory where the EDB audit directory folder is located.
 Select and right-click on the folder, select "Properties", and select the "Security" tab.
 Review the users and groups and permissions assigned to them for the folder.

Using a Windows command prompt, the following command may be used to list file permissions:

 icacls "&lt;EDB Audit directory&gt;"
 icacls "&lt;EDB Audit directory&gt;\*" 
 Review the users and groups and permissions assigned to them for the file(s).

 Note: The above commands will list the permissions for all files and folders under the data directory. To make the output of this command easier to review, it may be redirected to a text file.

Review the system security documentation. 
If read or greater permissions are granted to Everyone or to the Users group, this is a finding.
If any account other than the database service account, Administrators, or other documented users are listed as having Read permission, this is a finding.

By default, this parameter is set to "edb_audit", which results in a directory name "edb_audit" being created under the postgresql data directory. 

The location of the EDB Audit directory for a running EDB Postgres Advanced Server instance can be found using the following command run from a Windows command prompt:

 psql -d &lt;database name&gt; -U &lt;database superuser name&gt; -c "SHOW edb_audit_directory"

where, &lt;database name&gt; is any database in the EDB postgres instance and &lt;database superuser name&gt; is a database superuser. By default, a database named "edb" and a superuser named "enterprisedb" are installed with EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS). 

Note that the default location for the EDB postgresql data directory is found in the directory where EDB Postgres Advanced Server is installed. The location of the data directory for a running postgres instance can be found using the following command run from a Windows command prompt:

 psql -d &lt;database name&gt; -U &lt;database superuser name&gt; -c "SHOW data_directory"

where, &lt;database name&gt; is any database in the EDB postgres instance and &lt;database superuser name&gt; is a database superuser. By default, a database named "edb" and a superuser named "enterprisedb" are installed with EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS).

If the default path is used for the postgresql data directory and the default setting of "edb_audit" is used for the edb_audit_directory parameter, the path to the EDB audit directory would be &lt;EDB Postgres data directory&gt;\edb_audit. Depending on the version of EPAS that is installed, the options that were selected during installation, and the edb_audit_directory parameter setting, the path to the data directory and the EDB audit directory may be different.

First, determine ownership of the EDB audit directory folder. This can be done using Windows Explorer or via a Windows command prompt.

Using Windows Explorer:
 Browse to the directory where the EDB audit directory folder is located.
 Select and right-click on the folder, select "Properties", select the "Security" tab, and select the "Advanced" button. 
 Note the Value of the Owner field.

Using the Windows command prompt, enter the following command, replacing &lt;EDB Audit directory&gt; with the correct path for the EDB audit directory:

 dir "&lt;EDB Audit directory&gt;" /Q /S

 Note: The above command will list all of the files and folders under the audit directory. To make the output of this command easier to review, it may be redirected to a text file.

Review the system security documentation. If the owner listed for the folder and any of the files and subfolders in the EDB audit directory and its content is not the service account responsible for running the Advanced Server database service this is a finding. 

Next, check the permissions assigned to the EDB audit directory folder and its content. This can be done using Windows Explorer or via a Windows command prompt.

Using Windows Explorer:
 Browse to the directory where the EDB audit directory folder is located.
 Select and right-click on the folder, select "Properties", and select the "Security" tab.
 Review the users and groups and permissions assigned to them for the folder.

Using a Windows command prompt, the following command may be used to list file permissions:

 icacls "&lt;EDB Audit directory&gt;"
 icacls "&lt;EDB Audit directory&gt;\*" 
 Review the users and groups and permissions assigned to them for the file(s).

 Note: The above commands will list the permissions for all files and folders under the data directory. To make the output of this command easier to review, it may be redirected to a text file.

To ensure the veracity of audit data, the information system and/or the application must protect audit information from unauthorized deletion. This requirement can be achieved through multiple methods which will depend upon system architecture and design.

Some commonly employed methods include: ensuring log files enjoy the proper file system permissions utilizing file system protections; restricting access; and backing up log data to ensure log data is retained.

Applications providing a user interface to audit data will leverage user permissions and roles identifying the user accessing the data and the corresponding rights the user enjoys to make access decisions regarding the deletion of audit data.

Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity.

If the EDB Audit directory and its contents are not owned by the database service account, change ownership to the service account responsible for running the Advanced Server database service.

This may be done using Windows Explorer:
 Browse to the directory where the EDB audit directory folder is located.
 Select and right-click on the folder, select "Properties", select the "Securities" tab, and select the "Advanced" button.
 Select the "Change" link shown next to the owner of the folder to change the folder's owner.

Alternatively, the Windows TAKEOWN command or the ICACLS command (with the /SETOWNER option) may be used to change ownership of folders and files using the Windows command prompt.

2) Modify permissions on the EDB Audit directory and its contents to meet the requirement to protect against unauthorized access.

This may be done using Windows Explorer:
 Browse to the directory where the EDB audit directory folder is located.
 Select and right-click on the folder, select "Properties", and select the "Security" tab.
 Modify the security permissions to:
 NT AUTHORITY/NetworkService (or configured database service account) (Full Control)
 Administrators (Read)
 Users (none)

Alternatively, the Windows ICACLS command may be used to modify permissions on folders and files using the Windows command prompt.

If other permissions have been granted to other users or groups, ensure that the system documentation is updated to note the organizationally approved permission setting and corresponding justification of the permission settings for this requirement.</fixtext><fix id="F-25814r495480_fix" /><check system="C-25826r495479_chk"><check-content-ref href="EDB_Postgres_Advanced_Server_v11_on_Windows_STIG.xml" name="M" /><check-content>The location of the EDB audit directory is specified via the edb_audit_directory parameter. By default, this parameter is set to "edb_audit", which results in a directory name "edb_audit" being created under the postgresql data directory. 

The location of the EDB Audit directory for a running EDB Postgres Advanced Server instance can be found using the following command run from a Windows command prompt:

 psql -d &lt;database name&gt; -U &lt;database superuser name&gt; -c "SHOW edb_audit_directory"

where, &lt;database name&gt; is any database in the EDB postgres instance and &lt;database superuser name&gt; is a database superuser. By default, a database named "edb" and a superuser named "enterprisedb" are installed with EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS). 

Note that the default location for the EDB postgresql data directory is found in the directory where EDB Postgres Advanced Server is installed. The location of the data directory for a running postgres instance can be found using the following command run from a Windows command prompt:

 psql -d &lt;database name&gt; -U &lt;database superuser name&gt; -c "SHOW data_directory"

where, &lt;database name&gt; is any database in the EDB postgres instance and &lt;database superuser name&gt; is a database superuser. By default, a database named "edb" and a superuser named "enterprisedb" are installed with EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS).

If the default path is used for the postgresql data directory and the default setting of "edb_audit" is used for the edb_audit_directory parameter, the path to the EDB audit directory would be &lt;EDB Postgres data directory&gt;\edb_audit. Depending on the version of EPAS that is installed, the options that were selected during installation, and the edb_audit_directory parameter setting, the path to the data directory and the EDB audit directory may be different.

First, determine ownership of the EDB audit directory folder. This can be done using Windows Explorer or via a Windows command prompt.

Using Windows Explorer:
 Browse to the directory where the EDB audit directory folder is located.
 Select and right-click on the folder, select "Properties", select the "Security" tab, and select the "Advanced" button. 
 Note the Value of the Owner field.

Using the Windows command prompt, enter the following command, replacing &lt;EDB Audit directory&gt; with the correct path for the EDB audit directory:

 dir "&lt;EDB Audit directory&gt;" /Q /S

 Note: The above command will list all of the files and folders under the audit directory. To make the output of this command easier to review, it may be redirected to a text file.

Review the system security documentation. If the owner listed for the folder and any of the files and subfolders in the EDB audit directory and its content is not the service account responsible for running the Advanced Server database service this is a finding. 

Next, check the permissions assigned to the EDB audit directory folder and its content. Again, this can be done using Windows Explorer or via a Windows command prompt.

Using Windows Explorer:
 Browse to the directory where the EDB audit directory folder is located.
 Select and right-click on the folder, select "Properties", and select the "Security" tab.
 Review the users and groups and permissions assigned to them for the folder.

Using a Windows command prompt, the following command may be used to list file permissions:

 icacls "&lt;EDB Audit directory&gt;"
 icacls "&lt;EDB Audit directory&gt;\*" 
 Review the users and groups and permissions assigned to them for the file(s).

 Note: The above commands will list the permissions for all files and folders under the data directory. To make the output of this command easier to review, it may be redirected to a text file.

Review the system security documentation. 
If read or greater permissions are granted to Everyone or to the Users group, this is a finding.
If any account other than the database service account, Administrators, or other documented users are listed as having Read permission, this is a finding.
If any account other than the database service account or other documented users are listed as having the Full Control permission, this is a finding.
If any permissions are listed for any account other than the database service account that are not identified in the system documentation as being approved for the permission, this is a finding.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-224154"><title>SRG-APP-000133-DB-000179</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-224154r508023_rule" weight="10.0" severity="medium"><version>EP11-00-003200</version><title>Software, applications, and configuration files that are part of, or related to, the Postgres Plus Advanced Server installation must be monitored to discover unauthorized changes.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;If the system were to allow any user to make changes to software libraries, then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a robust change management process.

The Postgres COPY command provides options for reading or writing files or running a program that the server has privileges to access. These options are only allowed for users who have been granted superuser privilege or have been granted the pg_read_server_files, pg_write_server_files, or pg_execute_server_program roles. The SUPERUSER privilege and the roles that provide access to files on the underlying server should only be granted to approved users.

To check for user and group roles that have been granted the SUPERUSER privilege, execute the following SQL statement in psql or another Postgres SQL client as enterprisedb:

The above query will list all user and group roles that have either been granted the SUPERUSER privilege explicitly or via one of the roles in the hierarchy of roles they have been granted.

If a user or group roles has the SUPERUSER privilege either directly or via one of the roles in the hierarchy of roles it has been granted, and the role is not documented as being approved to have this privilege, this is a finding.

Applications are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations. Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single component (e.g., email and web services); however, doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component.

To support the requirements and principles of least functionality, the application must support the organizational requirements providing only essential capabilities and limiting the use of ports, protocols, and/or services to only those required, authorized, and approved to conduct official business or to address authorized quality of life issues.

Database Management Systems using ports, protocols, and services deemed unsafe are open to attack through those ports, protocols, and services. This can allow unauthorized access to the database and through the database to other components of the information system.

A Postgres database cluster (i.e., instance) listens for connections on a single TCP port. The default port for an EDB Postgres Advanced Server cluster is 5444; however, the port number that is used is configurable via the Postgres "port" parameter. A database restart is required to apply a change to the port parameter. Also by default, a Postgres cluster will listen for connections on all interfaces on the host. The "listen_addresses" parameter can be used to configure specific interfaces on the host to listen for connections. The default value of "*" indicates all interfaces are used. To listen only on specific interfaces, the listen_addresses parameter is configured with a comma-separated list of host names and/or numeric IP addresses corresponding to the interfaces that should be used. As with the port parameter, changes to the listen_addresses parameter requires a cluster restart to take effect.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target EDB Postgres Advanced Server v11 on Windows</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>EDB Postgres Advanced Server v11 on Windows</dc:subject><dc:identifier>4107</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">SV-109459</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">V-100355</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-000382</ident><fixtext fixref="F-25825r495511_fix">Execute the following SQL as enterprisedb:

To restart the database service, using the Windows Services Control Manager:
1. Open the Windows Services Control Manager.
2. Select the database service from the list of services, right-click it, and select "Restart".

Alternatively, the database can be restarted via the Windows command line using either the NET or SC command as follows:

 NET STOP &lt;service name&gt;
 NET START &lt;service name&gt;

or

 SC STOP &lt;service name&gt;
 SC START &lt;service name&gt;

Note that if pgAgent is installed and running, the corresponding pgAgent service is dependent on the EDB Postgres database service and will first need to be stopped in order to restart the database service. After restarting the database service, the pgAgent service may be started again.</fixtext><fix id="F-25825r495511_fix" /><check system="C-25837r495510_chk"><check-content-ref href="EDB_Postgres_Advanced_Server_v11_on_Windows_STIG.xml" name="M" /><check-content>Review documentation for approved list of ports, protocols, and addresses.

Before creating the password verification function, check whether the fuzzystrmatch extension is installed by executing the following SQL query as enterprisedb:

If "fuzzystrmatch" is not listed, execute the following SQL to install the extension as enterprisedb:

 CREATE EXTENSION fuzzystrmatch;

Normally, with PKI authentication, the interaction with the user for authentication will be handled by a software component separate from the DBMS, such as ActivIdentity ActivClient. However, in cases where the DBMS controls the interaction, this requirement applies.

To prevent the compromise of authentication information such as passwords and PINs during the authentication process, the feedback from the system must not provide any information that would allow an unauthorized user to compromise the authentication mechanism. 

Obfuscation of user-provided authentication secrets when typed into the system is a method used in addressing this risk. 

Displaying asterisks when a user types in a password or a smart card PIN is an example of obscuring feedback of authentication secrets.

This calls for review of applications, which will require collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers, and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored.

Weak algorithms can be easily broken and not validated cryptographic modules may not implement algorithms correctly. Unapproved cryptographic modules or algorithms should not be relied on for authentication, confidentiality, or integrity. Weak cryptography could allow an attacker to gain access to and modify data stored in the database as well as the administration settings of the DBMS.

Applications, including DBMSs, utilizing cryptography are required to use approved NIST FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules that meet the requirements of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.  

The security functions validated as part of FIPS 140-2 for cryptographic modules are described in FIPS 140-2 Annex A.

NSA Type-X (where X=1, 2, 3, 4) products are NSA-certified, hardware-based encryption modules.

Postgres uses OpenSSL for the underlying encryption layer. Organizations must obtain and use a FIPS 140-2 certified distribution of OpenSSL or build their own FIPS 140-2 OpenSSL libraries. EnterpriseDB has a FIPS 140-2 validated set of cryptographic modules for use with OpenSSL on Windows to meet this requirement for EDB Postgres Advanced Server deployments.

It is the responsibility of the data owner to assess the cryptography requirements in light of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards.

For detailed information, refer to NIST FIPS Publication 140-2, Security Requirements For Cryptographic Modules. Note that the product's cryptographic modules must be validated and certified by NIST as FIPS-compliant.

When the EDB FIPS 140-2 certified cryptographic modules are configured properly, an EDB Postgres Advanced Server will fail to start if non-FIPS 140-2 ciphers are specified for the Postgres ssl_ciphers parameter. To test whether the FIPS 140-2 compliant configuration is working, temporarily set the "ssl_ciphers" parameter in the postgresql.conf file to 'RC4-SHA' and then attempt to restart the database service. Since "RC4-SHA" is not a FIPS 140-2 approved cipher, the database will fail to start. Using the Event Viewer in Windows, a "FATAL: could not set the cipher list (no valid ciphers available)" error will be found under "Event Viewer (Local) &gt;&gt; Windows Logs &gt;&gt; Application".

Non-organizational users must be uniquely identified and authenticated for all accesses other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization when related to the use of anonymous access, such as accessing a web server.

Accordingly, a risk assessment is used in determining the authentication needs of the organization. 

Scalability, practicality, and security are simultaneously considered in balancing the need to ensure ease of use for access to federal information and information systems with the need to protect and adequately mitigate risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.

With Postgres, all database users are uniquely identified. To discriminate non-organizational users from organizational users, applications often create and utilize one or more tables to record additional information about the users, including their organizational affiliations. Another approach that may be used is to create and assign database roles corresponding to the different organizations. The EDB Postgres Advanced Server session audit log tagging feature can also be used to log additional information about the user associated with a database session such as organizational affiliation. The session audit tagging feature uses the edb_audit_tag parameter.

Failure to a known secure state helps prevent a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability in the event of a failure of the information system or a component of the system. 

Preserving information system state information helps to facilitate system restart and return to the operational mode of the organization with less disruption of mission/business processes. 

Since it is usually not possible to test this capability in a production environment, systems should either be validated in a testing environment or prior to installation. This requirement is usually a function of the design of the IDPS component. Compliance can be verified by acceptance/validation processes or vendor attestation.

At all times, Postgres maintains a write ahead log (WAL) in the pg_wal/ subdirectory of the cluster's data directory. The log records every change made to the database's data files. This log exists primarily for crash-safety purposes: if the system crashes, the database can be restored to consistency by “replaying” the log entries made since the last checkpoint. Under the covers, Postgres uses fsync system calls to help ensure that modified database information held in memory is written to disk. To support certain specialized use cases where crash recovery is not as important as system performance, Postgres provides an fsync parameter that can be set to "off" to disable the use of fsync. By default, this parameter is set to "on" and except for the rare use cases should not be set to "off".

 psql -d &lt;database name&gt; -U &lt;database superuser name&gt; -c "SHOW data_directory"

where, &lt;database name&gt; is any database in the EDB postgres instance and &lt;database superuser name&gt; is a database superuser. By default, a database named "edb" and a superuser named "enterprisedb" are installed with EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS).

1) Check Ownership of Postgresql Data Directory:
First, determine ownership of the postgresql data directory folder. This can be done using Windows Explorer or via a Windows command prompt.

Using Windows Explorer:
 Browse to the directory where the postgresql data directory folder is located.
 Select and right-click on the folder, select "Properties", and select the "Details" tab. 
 Note the Value of the Owner field.

Using the Windows command prompt, enter the following command:

 dir "&lt;postgresql data directory&gt;" /Q /S

 Note: The above command will list all of the files and folders under the data directory. To make the output of this command easier to review, it may be redirected to a text file.

Review the system security documentation. If the owner listed for the folder and any of the files and subfolders in the data directory is not the database service account and the configuration has not been documented and approved, this is a finding.

2) Check Permissions on Postgresql Data Directory
Check the permissions assigned to the postgresql data directory folder and its content. This can be done using Windows Explorer or via a Windows command prompt.

Using Windows Explorer:
 Browse to the directory where the postgresql data directory folder is located.
 Select and right-click on the folder, select "Properties", and select the "Security" tab.
 Review the users and groups and permissions assigned to them for the folder.

Using a Windows command prompt, the following command may be used to list file permissions:

 icacls "&lt;postgresql data directory&gt;"
 icacls "&lt;postgresql data directory&gt;\*" 
 Review the users and groups and permissions assigned to them for the file(s).

 Note: The above commands will list the permissions for all files and folders under the data directory. To make the output of this command easier to review, it may be redirected to a text file.

Review the system security documentation.
Verify that at most the following permissions are applied:
 NT AUTHORITY/NetworkService (or configured database service account) (Full Control)

This results in unanticipated application behavior, potentially leading to an application or information system compromise. Invalid user input is one of the primary methods employed when attempting to compromise an application.

With respect to database management systems, one class of threat is known as SQL Injection, or more generally, code injection. It takes advantage of the dynamic execution capabilities of various programming languages, including dialects of SQL. Potentially, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to data, including security settings, and severely corrupt or destroy the database.

Even when no such hijacking takes place, invalid input that is recorded in the database, whether accidental or malicious, reduces the reliability and usability of the system. Available protections include data types, referential constraints, uniqueness constraints, range checking, and application-specific logic. Application-specific logic can be implemented within the database in stored procedures and triggers, where appropriate.

This calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers, and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored.

Use strongly typed data items rather than general-purpose strings as input parameters to task-specific, pre-compiled stored procedures and functions (and triggers).

When dynamic execution is necessary, ways to mitigate the risk include the following, which should be implemented both in the on-screen application and at the database level, in the stored procedures:
-- Allow strings as input only when necessary.
-- Rely on data typing to validate numbers, dates, etc. Do not accept invalid values. If substituting other values for them, think carefully about whether this could be subverted.
-- Limit the size of input strings to what is truly necessary.
-- If single quotes/apostrophes, double quotes, semicolons, equals signs, angle brackets, or square brackets will never be valid as input, reject them.
-- If comment markers will never be valid as input, reject them. In SQL, these are -- or /* */
-- If HTML and XML tags, entities, comments, etc., will never be valid, reject them.
-- If wildcards are present, reject them unless truly necessary. In SQL these are the underscore and the percentage sign, and the word ESCAPE is also a clue that wildcards are in use.
-- If SQL key words, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP, ESCAPE, UNION, GRANT, and REVOKE will never be valid, reject them. Use case-insensitive comparisons when searching for these. Bear in mind that some of these words, particularly “Grant” (as a person's name), could also be valid input.
-- If there are range limits on the values that may be entered, enforce those limits.
-- Institute procedures for inspection of programs for correct use of dynamic coding, by a party other than the developer.
-- Conduct rigorous testing of program modules that use dynamic coding, searching for ways to subvert the intended use.
-- Record the inspection and testing in the system documentation.
-- Bear in mind that all this applies not only to screen input, but also to the values in an incoming message to a web service or to a stored procedure called by a software component that has not itself been hardened in these ways. Not only can the caller be subject to such vulnerabilities; it may itself be the attacker.

Carefully consider the structure/content of error messages.

Some default EDB Postgres Advanced Server error messages can contain information that could aid an attacker in, among others things, identifying the database type, host address, or state of the database. Custom errors may contain sensitive customer information.

It is important that detailed error messages be visible only to those who are authorized to view them; that general users receive only generalized acknowledgment that errors have occurred; and that these generalized messages appear only when relevant to the user's task. For example, a message along the lines of, "An error has occurred. Unable to save your changes. If this problem persists, please contact your help desk" would be relevant. A message such as "Warning: your transaction generated a large number of page splits" would likely not be relevant.

Administrative users authorized to review detailed error messages typically are the ISSO, ISSM, SA, and DBA. Other individuals or roles may be specified according to organization-specific needs, with appropriate approval.

In addition to ensuring that access to EDB Postgres Advanced Server database and audit logs is restricted to authorized users and that EDB Postgres Advanced Server is configured to emit minimal information to clients related to Postgres generated errors, custom database code and external application code should also be designed to not emit detailed error messages to a client. This calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers, and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the DBA must attempt to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been addressed, and must document what has been discovered.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target EDB Postgres Advanced Server v11 on Windows</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>EDB Postgres Advanced Server v11 on Windows</dc:subject><dc:identifier>4107</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">V-100395</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">SV-109499</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-001314</ident><fixtext fixref="F-25847r495577_fix"># Set client_min_messages
To set the level of detail for errors messages exposed to clients, connect to the database as a database superuser using psql and execute the following commands:

 ALTER SYSTEM SET client_min_messages = notice;
 SELECT pg_reload_conf();

# Update EDB Postgres Advanced Server database log permissions.
If the EDB Postgres Advanced Server log_destination parameter is set to "stderr" or "csvlog":

1) Change ownership of EDB Postgres Advanced Server database log directory and its contents to the database service account if they are not owned by the database service account.

If the EDB Postgres Advanced Server database log directory and its contents are not owned by the database service account, change ownership to the service account responsible for running the Advanced Server database service.

This may be done using Windows Explorer:
 Browse to the directory where the log directory folder is located.
 Select and right-click on the folder, select "Properties", select the "Securities" tab, and select the "Advanced" button.
 Select the "Change" link shown next to the owner of the folder to change the folder's owner.

Alternatively, the Windows TAKEOWN command or the ICACLS command (with the /SETOWNER option) may be used to change ownership of folders and files using the Windows command prompt.

2) Modify permissions on the EDB Postgres Advanced Server database log directory and its contents to meet the requirement to protect against unauthorized access.

This may be done using Windows Explorer:
 Browse to the directory where the log directory folder is located.
 Select and right-click on the folder, select "Properties", and select the "Security" tab.
 Modify the security permissions to:
 NT AUTHORITY/NetworkService (or configured database service account) (Full Control)
 Administrators (Read)
 Users (none)

Alternatively, the Windows ICACLS command may be used to modify permissions on folders and files using the Windows command prompt.

If the EDB Postgres Advanced Server log_destination parameter is set to "eventlog", update the Windows policy settings to only allow access to the Windows Application event log to authorized users.

If other permissions have been granted to other users or groups, ensure that the system documentation is updated to note the organizationally approved permission setting and corresponding justification of the permission settings for this requirement.

# Update EDB Audit log permissions.
1) Change ownership of EDB Audit directory and its contents to the database service account if they are not owned by the database service account.

If the EDB Audit directory and its contents are not owned by the database service account, change ownership to the service account responsible for running the Advanced Server database service.

This may be done using Windows Explorer:
 Browse to the directory where the EDB audit directory folder is located.
 Select and right-click on the folder, select "Properties", select the "Securities" tab, and select the "Advanced" button.
 Select the "Change" link shown next to the owner of the folder to change the folder's owner.

Alternatively, the Windows TAKEOWN command or the ICACLS command (with the /SETOWNER option) may be used to change ownership of folders and files using the Windows command prompt.

2) Modify permissions on the EDB Audit directory and its contents to meet the requirement to protect against unauthorized access.

This may be done using Windows Explorer:
 Browse to the directory where the EDB audit directory folder is located.
 Select and right-click on the folder, select "Properties", and select the "Security" tab.
 Modify the security permissions to:
 NT AUTHORITY/NetworkService (or configured database service account) (Full Control)
 Administrators (Read)
 Users (none)

Alternatively, the Windows ICACLS command may be used to modify permissions on folders and files using the Windows command prompt.

If other permissions have been granted to other users or groups, ensure that the system documentation is updated to note the organizationally approved permission setting and corresponding justification of the permission settings for this requirement.

# Update custom database code and application code

Check the level of detail for errors exposed to clients, connect to the database as a database superuser using psql and execute the following psql command:

 SHOW client_min_messages

If client_min_messages is set to LOG or DEBUG, this is a finding.

# Verify access to database logs and audit log restricted to authorized users
Verify that only authorized users are able to access EDB Postgres Advanced Server database and audit logs that may contain detailed error messages. By default, these logs are written to directories under the EDB Postgres Advanced Server data directory. The full path of the data directory can be determined by connecting to the database as a database superuser using psql and execute the following psql command:

 SHOW data_directory

To check the access permissions assigned to the database logs, first determine where the logs are being written by connecting to the database as a database superuser using psql and execute the following psql command:

 SHOW log_destination

# Verify access to database logs (stderr or csvlog)
If the log_destination parameter is set to "stderr" or "csvlog", next determine the directory on the files system where the logs are being written by connecting to the database as a database superuser using psql and execute the following psql command:

 SHOW log_directory

If the log_directory parameter is set to a relative path, database logs have been configured to be written to the named directory under the EDB Postgres Advanced Server data directory. 

If the log_directory parameter is set to an absolute path, database logs have been configured to be written to that location.

Next, determine ownership of the log directory folder. This can be done using Windows Explorer or via a Windows command prompt.

Using Windows Explorer:
 Browse to the directory where the log directory folder is located.
 Select and right-click on the folder, select "Properties", select the "Security" tab, and select the "Advanced" button. 
 Note the Value of the Owner field.

Using the Windows command prompt, enter the following command, replacing &lt;EDB log directory&gt; with the correct path for the log directory:

 dir "&lt;EDB log directory&gt;" /Q /S

 Note: The above command will list all of the files and folders under the audit directory. To make the output of this command easier to review, it may be redirected to a text file.

Review the system security documentation. If the owner listed for the folder and any of the files and subfolders in the EDB log directory and its content is not the service account responsible for running the Advanced Server database service this is a finding. 

Next, check the permissions assigned to the EDB log directory folder and its content. Again, this can be done using Windows Explorer or via a Windows command prompt.

Using Windows Explorer:
 Browse to the directory where the EDB log directory folder is located.
 Select and right-click on the folder, select "Properties", and select the "Security" tab.
 Review the users and groups and permissions assigned to them for the folder.

Using a Windows command prompt, the following command may be used to list file permissions:

 icacls "&lt;EDB log directory&gt;"
 icacls "&lt;EDB log directory&gt;\*" 
 Review the users and groups and permissions assigned to them for the file(s).

 Note: The above commands will list the permissions for all files and folders under the log directory. To make the output of this command easier to review, it may be redirected to a text file.

Review the system security documentation. 
If read or greater permissions are granted to Everyone or to the Users group, this is a finding.
If any account other than the database service account, Administrators, or other documented users are listed as having Read permission, this is a finding.
If any account other than the database service account or other documented users are listed as having the Full Control permission, this is a finding.
If any permissions are listed for any account other than the database service account that are not identified in the system documentation as being approved for the permission, this is a finding.

# Verify access to database logs (eventlog)
If the log_destination parameter is set to "eventlog", logs are written to the Windows Application event log. Review system security documentation and the Windows event log local and group policy settings. If the configured Windows Event Log policies give access to the Windows Application event log to any system users who are not documented as approved to view EDB Postgres Advanced Server logs, this is a finding.

# Verify access to audit logs
First determine the directory on the files system where the EDB Audit logs are being written by connecting to the database as a database superuser using psql and execute the following psql command:

 SHOW edb_audit_directory

If the edb_audit_directory parameter is set to a relative path, database logs have been configured to be written to the named directory under the EDB Postgres Advanced Server data directory. 

If the log_directory parameter is set to an absolute path, database logs have been configured to be written to that location.

Next, determine ownership of the EDB audit directory folder. This can be done using Windows Explorer or via a Windows command prompt.

Using Windows Explorer:
 Browse to the directory where the EDB audit directory folder is located.
 Select and right-click on the folder, select "Properties", select the "Security" tab, and select the "Advanced" button. 
 Note the Value of the Owner field.

Using the Windows command prompt, enter the following command, replacing &lt;EDB Audit directory&gt; with the correct path for the EDB audit directory:

 dir "&lt;EDB Audit directory&gt;" /Q /S

 Note: The above command will list all of the files and folders under the audit directory. To make the output of this command easier to review, it may be redirected to a text file.

Review the system security documentation. If the owner listed for the folder and any of the files and subfolders in the EDB audit directory and its content is not the service account responsible for running the Advanced Server database service this is a finding. 

Next, check the permissions assigned to the EDB audit directory folder and its content. Again, this can be done using Windows Explorer or via a Windows command prompt.

Using Windows Explorer:

 Select and right-click on the folder, select "Properties", and select the "Security" tab.
 Review the users and groups and permissions assigned to them for the folder.

Using a Windows command prompt, the following command may be used to list file permissions:

 icacls "&lt;EDB Audit directory&gt;"
 icacls "&lt;EDB Audit directory&gt;\*" 
 Review the users and groups and permissions assigned to them for the file(s).

 Note: The above commands will list the permissions for all files and folders under the data directory. To make the output of this command easier to review, it may be redirected to a text file.

Review the system security documentation. 
If read or greater permissions are granted to Everyone or to the Users group, this is a finding.
If any account other than the database service account, Administrators, or other documented users are listed as having Read permission, this is a finding.
If any account other than the database service account or other documented users are listed as having the Full Control permission, this is a finding.
If any permissions are listed for any account other than the database service account that are not identified in the system documentation as being approved for the permission, this is a finding.

A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user access) without terminating network sessions.

Session termination ends all processes associated with a user's logical session except those batch processes/jobs that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated.

Conditions or trigger events requiring automatic session termination can include, for example, organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, and time-of-day restrictions on information system use.

Security labels are abstractions representing the basic properties or characteristics of an entity (e.g., subjects and objects) with respect to safeguarding information.

These labels are typically associated with internal data structures (e.g., tables, rows) within the database and are used to enable the implementation of access control and flow control policies, reflect special dissemination, handling or distribution instructions, or support other aspects of the information security policy.

One example includes marking data as classified or FOUO.

Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object or via specified ownership assignment. DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes user-controlled table permissions.

When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or objects. 

A subject that is constrained in its operation by Mandatory Access Control policies is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this requirement. Thus, while Mandatory Access Control imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity level, this requirement permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level. 

The policy is bounded by the information system boundary. Once the information is passed outside of the control of the information system, additional means may be required to ensure the constraints remain in effect.

If an unapproved user or group role is the owner of a database object, change the owner to an approved user or group role using one of the following ALTER SQL commands as appropriate:

  The syntax is:
     ALTER DATABASE &lt;database name&gt; OWNER TO &lt;new_owner&gt;

System documentation should include a definition of the functionality considered privileged.

Depending on circumstances, privileged functions can include, for example, establishing accounts, performing system integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals that do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users.

A privileged function in the DBMS/database context is any operation that modifies the structure of the database, its built-in logic, or its security settings. This would include all Data Definition Language (DDL) statements and all security-related statements. In an SQL environment, it encompasses, but is not necessarily limited to:
CREATE
ALTER
DROP
GRANT
REVOKE

There may also be Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements that, subject to context, should be regarded as privileged. Possible examples include:

TRUNCATE TABLE;
DELETE, or
DELETE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or
DELETE without a WHERE clause;

UPDATE or
UPDATE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or
UPDATE without a WHERE clause;

any SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE to an application-defined security table executed by other than a security principal.

Depending on the capabilities of the DBMS and the design of the database and associated applications, the prevention of unauthorized use of privileged functions may be achieved by means of DBMS security features, database triggers, other mechanisms, or a combination of these.

In Postgres, a user or group role that has been granted the SUPERUSER privilege can perform any action in the database. As such, the SUPERUSER privilege should only be granted to a limited set of approved users. The SUPERUSER privilege can be assigned to a role when the role is created. It can also be assigned or removed from a role via an ALTER ROLE statement.

Postgres also provides the CREATEROLE, CREATEDB, REPLICATION, and BYPASSURLS privileges that can be granted to non-superuser roles to allow them to perform a limited set of privileged activities such as creating databases, creating user and group roles, managing replication slots, and bypassing row level security restrictions. Although not as all-encompassing as the SUPERUSER privilege, these privileges must only be granted to users who are approved to perform these activities. Like the SUPERUSER privilege, these privileges can be assigned to a role when the role is created. They can also be assigned or removed from a role via an ALTER ROLE statement. The PostgreSQL CREATE ROLE documentation provides more information about these privileges. See: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createrole.html

In addition to the SUPERUSER, CREATEDB, and CREATEROLE privileges, a user may be granted one or more default roles that provide access to certain privileged capabilities and activities. A listing and description of the default roles provided with Postgres is documented at the following link:

 https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/default-roles.html

Roles and privileges on database objects can be granted to or revoked from a user using the GRANT and REVOKE statements. Users that are granted a role with the ADMIN OPTION can in turn grant the role to other users and roles. The ADMIN OPTION should only be granted to user and group roles that are approved to grant the roles. A description of the available privileges that may be granted to the different types of Postgres database objects is documented at the following link:

 https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-priv.html

Also in Postgres, for most object types, object owners can perform any action on the objects they own, including dropping or altering them and assigning or revoking privileges on them. As such, database objects should only be owned by users who are approved to own them.

Another security risk to consider, is that Postgres can be extended with additional procedural languages that can be used to create user defined functions (i.e., not provided by EDB Postgres Advanced Server out-of-the-box). Some of these languages, such as pl/Python and pl/R are defined as "untrusted" languages. Any users who are granted access to these untrusted languages are able to run user defined functions to escalate privileges and perform unintended functions. These languages allow a Postgres database to be extended with additional capabilities that may be of benefit to a system. However, usage of these languages should only be granted to approved users for documented and approved purposes.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target EDB Postgres Advanced Server v11 on Windows</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>EDB Postgres Advanced Server v11 on Windows</dc:subject><dc:identifier>4107</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">SV-109509</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">V-100405</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-002235</ident><fixtext fixref="F-25853r495595_fix">Update system documentation to accurately identify all user and group roles that are authorized to perform privileged actions.

If the SUPERUSER, CREATEROLE, CREATEDB, REPLICATION, or BYPASSRLS privileges have been assigned to a user or group role that is not approved to have these privileges, remove the privilege using the ALTER ROLE SQL command as necessary.

 The syntax is:
 ALTER ROLE &lt;role&gt; NOSUPERUSER
 ALTER ROLE &lt;role&gt; NOCREATEROLE
 ALTER ROLE &lt;role&gt; NOCREATEDB
 ALTER ROLE &lt;role&gt; NOREPLICATION
 ALTER ROLE &lt;role&gt; NOBYPASSURLS

 Examples: 
 ALTER ROLE testuser NOSUPERUSER
 ALTER ROLE testuser NOCREATEROLE
 ALTER ROLE testuser NOCREATEDB
 ALTER ROLE testuser NOREPLICATION
 ALTER ROLE testuser NOBYPASSURLS

If an unapproved user or group role is the owner of a database object, change the owner to an approved user or group role using one of the following ALTER SQL commands as appropriate:

 The syntax is:
 ALTER DATABASE &lt;database name&gt; OWNER TO &lt;new_owner&gt;
 ALTER SCHEMA &lt;schema name&gt; OWNER TO &lt;new_owner&gt;
 ALTER TABLE &lt;table name&gt; OWNER TO &lt;new_owner&gt;
 ALTER SEQUENCE &lt;sequence name&gt; OWNER TO &lt;new_owner&gt;
 ALTER VIEW &lt;view name&gt; OWNER TO &lt;new_owner&gt;
 ALTER FUNCTION &lt;function name&gt; (&lt;args&gt;) OWNER TO &lt;new_owner&gt;
 ALTER PROCEDURE &lt;procedure name&gt; (&lt;args&gt;) OWNER TO &lt;new_owner&gt;

 Examples:
 ALTER DATABASE test_db OWNER TO app_admin
 ALTER SCHEMA test_schema OWNER TO app_admin
 ALTER TABLE test_tbl OWNER TO app_admin
 ALTER SEQUENCE test_seq OWNER TO app_admin
 ALTER VIEW test_vw OWNER TO app_admin
 ALTER FUNCTION test_func (p1 numeric, p2 text) OWNER TO app_admin
 ALTER PROCEDURE test_proc (p1 numeric, p2 text) OWNER TO app_admin

If a user or group role has been granted an unapproved role or object privilege, execute the appropriate REVOKE command as documented here:

 http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-revoke.html

Update the system documentation to identify the intended use, scope, and justification for any "untrusted" procedural languages that are being used for user defined functions as well as the users who are approved to use these languages and corresponding functions.

If an unapproved user defined function exists, remove it from the database by executing the DROP FUNCTION SQL command as documented here:

 https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-dropfunction.html

If an unapproved procedural language is installed, remove it from the database by executing the following SQL command:

 DROP EXTENSION &lt;extension_name&gt;</fixtext><fix id="F-25853r495595_fix" /><check system="C-25865r495594_chk"><check-content-ref href="EDB_Postgres_Advanced_Server_v11_on_Windows_STIG.xml" name="M" /><check-content>Review the system documentation to obtain the definition of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server functionality considered privileged in the context of the system in question.

Review the EDB Postgres Advanced Server security configuration and/or other means used to protect privileged functionality from unauthorized use.

If the configuration does not protect all of the actions defined as privileged, this is a finding.

To list the user and group roles in an EDB Postgres Advanced Server along with the privileges that have been assigned to each role and the roles that have been granted to each role, execute the following command in psql as a database superuser:

 \du+

If any user or group role is assigned a privilege or is a member of a role that provides the ability to perform an action that is considered privileged and is not documented as being approved to have these privileges or roles, this is a finding.

# Check for SUPERUSER privilege

The above query will list all user and group roles that have either been granted the SUPERUSER privilege explicitly, or via one of the roles in the hierarchy of roles they have been granted.

If a user or group role has the SUPERUSER privilege either directly or via one of the roles in the hierarchy of roles it has been granted and the role is not documented as being approved to have this privilege, this is a finding.

The above query will list all user and group roles that have either been granted the CREATEROLE, CREATEDB, REPLICATION, or BYPASSRLS privileges explicitly or via one of the roles in the hierarchy of roles they have been granted.

If a user or group role has one of these privileges either directly or via one of the roles in the hierarchy of roles it has been granted and the role is not documented as being approved to have this privilege, this is a finding.

# Check for default role assignments 
In addition to the SUPERUSER, CREATEDB, and CREATEROLE privileges, a user may be granted one or more default roles that provide access to certain privileged capabilities and activities. A listing and description of the default roles provided with Postgres is documented at the following link:

 https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/default-roles.html

To check for user and group roles that have been granted a role, execute the following SQL statement in psql or another Postgres SQL client as a database administrator, replacing &lt;ROLE NAME&gt; with the name of the role to be checked:

 WITH RECURSIVE roles( granted_role_id, granted_role_name, role_id, role_name, can_login, root_role_name )
 AS (
 SELECT NULL::oid granted_role_id

 GROUP BY role_name
 ) rr 
 ON r.role_name = rr.role_name
 WHERE gr.granted_roles IS NOT NULL
 ORDER BY 1;

Note that in the above query, to do a check for more than one role in a single query, replace "r1.rolname = '&lt;ROLE NAME&gt;'" with a comma separated list of roles in an SQL "IN" clause (e.g., "r1.rolname IN ( '&lt;ROLE 1 NAME&gt;', '&lt;ROLE 2 NAME&gt;', 
&lt;'ROLE N NAME'&gt; )").

The above query will list all user and group roles that have been granted the specified role(s) either explicitly or via one of the roles in the hierarchy of roles they have been granted.

If a user or group role has been granted one of the default privileged roles explicitly or via one of the roles in the hierarchy of roles they have been granted, and the role is not documented as being approved to have this role, this is a finding.

Although another requirement (SRG-APP-000515-DB-000318) mandates that audit data be off-loaded to a centralized log management system, it remains necessary to provide space on the database server to serve as a buffer against outages and capacity limits of the off-loading mechanism.

The task of allocating audit record storage capacity is usually performed during initial installation of the DBMS and is closely associated with the DBA and system administrator roles. The DBA or system administrator will usually coordinate the allocation of physical drive space with the application owner/installer and the application will prompt the installer to provide the capacity information, the physical location of the disk, or both.

In determining the capacity requirements, consider such factors as: total number of users; expected number of concurrent users during busy periods; number and type of events being monitored; types and amounts of data being captured; the frequency/speed with which audit records are off-loaded to the central log management system; and any limitations that exist on the DBMS's ability to reuse the space formerly occupied by off-loaded records.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target EDB Postgres Advanced Server v11 on Windows</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>EDB Postgres Advanced Server v11 on Windows</dc:subject><dc:identifier>4107</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">V-100415</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">SV-109519</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-001849</ident><fixtext fixref="F-25858r495610_fix">Allocate sufficient audit file space to the partition containing the EDB Audit directory to support peak demand.

If there have been incidents, this is a finding.

To check how much storage capacity is available for audit records, first determine the location where the EDB audit logs are being written by executing the following command run from a Windows command prompt:

 psql -d &lt;database name&gt; -U &lt;database superuser name&gt; -c "SHOW edb_audit_directory"

where, &lt;database name&gt; is any database in the EDB postgres instance and &lt;database superuser name&gt; is a database superuser. By default, a database named "edb" and a superuser named "enterprisedb" are installed with EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS). 

Note that the default location for the EDB postgresql data directory is found in the directory where EDB Postgres Advanced Server is installed. The location of the data directory for a running postgres instance can be found using the following command run from a Windows command prompt:

 psql -d &lt;database name&gt; -U &lt;database superuser name&gt; -c "SHOW data_directory"

where, &lt;database name&gt; is any database in the EDB postgres instance and &lt;database superuser name&gt; is a database superuser. By default, a database named "edb" and a superuser named "enterprisedb" are installed with EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS).

If the default path is used for the postgresql data directory and the default setting of "edb_audit" is used for the edb_audit_directory parameter, the path to the EDB audit directory would be &lt;EDB Postgres data directory&gt;\edb_audit. Depending on the version of EPAS installed, the options selected during installation, and the edb_audit_directory parameter setting, the path to the data directory and the EDB audit directory may be different.

With the EDB audit directory identified, note the disk on which this directory exists. Use the Windows Disk Management panel to determine how much space has been allocated to the disk and how much space remains. The Disk Management panel can be opened via "Start &gt; Run &gt; diskmgmt.msc". To determine the capacity, used, and free space on the disk via the Windows Explorer, right click to select the disk, and then select the "Properties" menu option. To determine how much space is currently being consumed by the audit log using Windows Explorer, right click select the audit directory and then select the "Properties" menu option.

If the remaining storage on the disk does not meet organizationally defined audit record storage requirements, this is a finding.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-224198"><title>SRG-APP-000359-DB-000319</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-224198r508023_rule" weight="10.0" severity="medium"><version>EP11-00-008000</version><title>The EDB Postgres Advanced Server must provide a warning to appropriate support staff when allocated audit record storage volume reaches 75% of maximum audit record storage capacity.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Organizations are required to use a central log management system, so, under normal conditions, the audit space allocated to EDB Postgres on its own server will not be an issue.

To restart the database service, using the Windows Services Control Manager:
 1. Open the Windows Services Control Manager.
 2. Select the database service from the list of services, right-click it, and select "Restart".

Alternatively, the database can be restarted via the Windows command line using either the NET or SC command as follows:

 NET STOP &lt;service name&gt;
 NET START &lt;service name&gt;

 SC STOP &lt;service name&gt;
 SC START &lt;service name&gt;

In the above commands, replace &lt;service name&gt; with the actual service name corresponding to the EDB Postgres instance.

Note that if pgAgent is installed and running, the corresponding pgAgent service is dependent on the EDB Postgres database service and must first be stopped to restart the database service.

EDB Postgres Advanced Server provides native support for using SSL connections to encrypt client/server communications. To enable the use of SSL, the postgres “ssl” configuration parameter must be set to “on” and the database instance needs to be configured to use a valid server certificate and private key installed on the server. With SSL enabled, connections made to the database server will default to being encrypted. However, it is possible for clients to override the default and attempt to establish an unencrypted connection. To prevent connections made from non-local hosts from being unencrypted, the postgres host-based authentication settings should be configured to only allow hostssl (i.e., encrypted) connections. The hostssl connections can be further configured to require the client present a valid (trusted) SSL certificate for a connection.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target EDB Postgres Advanced Server v11 on Windows</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>EDB Postgres Advanced Server v11 on Windows</dc:subject><dc:identifier>4107</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">V-100437</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">SV-109541</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-002420</ident><fixtext fixref="F-25869r557401_fix">To configure EDB Postgres Advanced Server to use SSL, open the ”postgresql.conf" file in an editor.

The location of the postgresql.conf for a running EDB Postgres instance can be found by connecting to the database as a database superuser using psql and executing the following command:

   SHOW config_file;

In the postgresql.conf file, set the “ssl” parameter as follows:

   ssl = on

Make sure the parameter is uncommented. 

In order to start an EDB Postgres Advance Server instance in SSL mode, files containing the server certificate and private key must exist. By default, these files are expected to exist in the Postgres data directory and are expected to be named server.crt and server.key, respectively. Update the ssl_cert_file and ssl_cert_key parameters in the postgresql.conf file if the files are placed in a different location or are named differently. 
Note that changes to the ssl parameter setting and any of the other ssl related parameters require a reload of the database server configuration to put the changes into effect. 
To reload the database server configuration, connect to the database as a database superuser using psql and execute the following command:
   SELECT pg_reload_conf();
After verifying that SSL is enabled for the database, open the pg_hba.conf file in an editor to configure the host-based authentication settings. Note the default location for the pg_hba.conf file is in the postgresql data directory. The location of the pg_hba.conf file for a running EDB postgres instance can be found by connecting to the database as a database superuser using psql and execute the following command:
   SHOW hba_file;

Obtain approval and document any uncommented entries with corresponding justification that are not of type hostssl and do not include the “clientcert=1” option.

For any entries that are not of type hostssl authentication with the “clientcert=1” option and not documented and approved, change the "TYPE" column to “hostssl” and add the “clientcert=1” authentication method option. 

Note on Microsoft Windows systems, changes to the host-based authentication settings in the pg_hba.conf file are immediately applied by subsequent new connections.

When receiving data, the DBMS, associated applications, and infrastructure must leverage protection mechanisms.
EDB Postgres Advanced Server provides native support for using SSL connections to encrypt client/server communications. To enable the use of SSL, the postgres “ssl” configuration parameter must be set to “on” and the database instance needs to be configured to use a valid server certificate and private key installed on the server. With SSL enabled, connections made to the database server will default to being encrypted. However, it is possible for clients to override the default and attempt to establish an unencrypted connection. To prevent connections made from non-local hosts from being unencrypted, the postgres host-based authentication settings should be configured to only allow hostssl (i.e., encrypted) connections. The hostssl connections can be further configured to require the client present a valid (trusted) SSL certificate for a connection.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target EDB Postgres Advanced Server v11 on Windows</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>EDB Postgres Advanced Server v11 on Windows</dc:subject><dc:identifier>4107</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">V-100439</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">SV-109543</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-002422</ident><fixtext fixref="F-25870r557407_fix">To configure EDB Postgres Advanced Server to use SSL, open the ”postgresql.conf" file in an editor. Note the default location for the postgresql.conf file is in the postgresql data directory. The location of the postgresql.conf for a running EDB Postgres instance can be found by connecting to the database as a database superuser using psql and executing the following command:

   SHOW config_file;

In the postgresql.conf file, set the “ssl” parameter as follows:

   ssl = on

Make sure the parameter is uncommented. 

In order to start an EDB Postgres Advanced Server instance in SSL mode, files containing the server certificate and private key must exist. By default, these files are expected to exist in the Postgres data directory and are expected to be named server.crt and server.key, respectively. Update the ssl_cert_file and ssl_cert_key parameters in the postgresql.conf file if the files are placed in a different location or are named differently. 
Note changes to the ssl parameter setting and any of the other ssl related parameters require a reload of the database server configuration to put the changes into effect. 
To reload the database server configuration, connect to the database as a database superuser using psql and execute the following command:
   SELECT pg_reload_conf();
After verifying SSL is enabled for the database, open the pg_hba.conf file in an editor to configure the host-based authentication settings. Note the default location for the pg_hba.conf file is in the postgresql data directory. The location of the pg_hba.conf file for a running EDB postgres instance can be found by connecting to the database as a database superuser using psql and execute the following command:
   SHOW hba_file;
Obtain approval and document any uncommented entries with corresponding justification that are not of type hostssl and do not include the “clientcert=1” option.

For any entries that are not of type hostssl authentication with the “clientcert=1” option and not documented and approved, change the "TYPE" column to “hostssl” and add the “clientcert=1” authentication method option. 

Note that on Microsoft Windows systems, changes to the host-based authentication settings in the pg_hba.conf file are immediately applied by subsequent new connections.

Vendors are constantly updating and patching their products to address newly discovered security vulnerabilities. Organizations (including any contractor to the organization) are required to promptly install security-relevant software updates (e.g., patches, service packs, and hot fixes). Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system error handling must also be addressed expeditiously.

Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software may vary based on a variety of factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw).

This requirement will apply to software patch management solutions that are used to install patches across the enclave and also to applications themselves that are not part of that patch management solution. For example, many browsers today provide the capability to install their own patch software. Patch criticality, as well as system criticality, will vary. Therefore, the tactical situations regarding the patch management process will also vary. This means the time period utilized must be a configurable parameter. Timeframes for application of security-relevant software updates may be dependent upon the Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process.

The application will be configured to check for and install security-relevant software updates within an identified time period from the availability of the update. The specific time period will be defined by an authoritative source (e.g., IAVM, CTOs, DTMs, and STIGs).&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target EDB Postgres Advanced Server v11 on Windows</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>EDB Postgres Advanced Server v11 on Windows</dc:subject><dc:identifier>4107</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">SV-109547</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">V-100443</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-002605</ident><fixtext fixref="F-25872r495651_fix">Institute and adhere to policies and procedures to ensure that patches are consistently obtained from EnterpriseDB and applied to the DBMS within the time allowed.

Weak algorithms can be easily broken and not validated cryptographic modules may not implement algorithms correctly. Unapproved cryptographic modules or algorithms should not be relied on for authentication, confidentiality, or integrity. Weak cryptography could allow an attacker to gain access to and modify data stored in the database as well as the administration settings of the DBMS.

Applications, including DBMSs, utilizing cryptography are required to use approved NIST FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules that meet the requirements of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. 

The security functions validated as part of FIPS 140-2 for cryptographic modules are described in FIPS 140-2 Annex A.

NSA Type-X (where X=1, 2, 3, 4) products are NSA-certified, hardware-based encryption modules.

Postgres uses OpenSSL for the underlying encryption layer. Organizations must obtain and use a FIPS 140-2 certified distribution of OpenSSL or build their own FIPS 140-2 OpenSSL libraries. EnterpriseDB has a FIPS 140-2 validated set of cryptographic modules for use with OpenSSL on Windows to meet this requirement for EDB Postgres Advanced Server deployments. 

When the EDB FIPS 140-2 certified cryptographic modules are configured properly, an EDB Postgres Advanced Server will fail to start if non-FIPS 140-2 ciphers are specified for the Postgres ssl_ciphers parameter. To test whether the FIPS 140-2 compliant configuration is working, temporarily set the "ssl_ciphers" parameter in the postgresql.conf file to 'RC4-SHA' and then attempt to restart the database service. Since "RC4-SHA" is not a FIPS 140-2 approved cipher, the database will fail to start. On Windows, using the Event Viewer, a "FATAL: could not set the cipher list (no valid ciphers available)" error will be found under "Event Viewer (Local) &gt;&gt; Windows Logs &gt;&gt; Application".&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target EDB Postgres Advanced Server v11 on Windows</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>EDB Postgres Advanced Server v11 on Windows</dc:subject><dc:identifier>4107</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">V-100513</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">SV-109617</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-000803</ident><fixtext fixref="F-25903r495744_fix">Edit &lt;postgresql data dir&gt;\pg_hba.conf so that each uncommented line starts with "hostssl".
