The lack of authorization-based access control could result in the immediate compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive information. All DoD systems must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods that do not rely solely on authentication for authorized access.

Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization.

The CA API Gateway has the ability to integrate with third-party identity providers such as Active Directory. Users within the identity providers should be granted access to the Registered Services as needed through the use of policies within the Registered Services.

Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. ALGs must use these policies and mechanisms to control access on behalf of the application for which it is acting as intermediary.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target CA API Gateway ALG</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>CA API Gateway ALG</dc:subject><dc:identifier>3049</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-000213</ident><fixtext fixref="F-77589r1_fix">Open the CA API Gateway - Policy Manager.

The flow of all network traffic must be monitored and controlled so it does not introduce any unacceptable risk to the network infrastructure or data.

Information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms are commonly employed by organizations to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, devices) within information systems. Examples of information flow control restrictions include keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet or blocking information marked as classified but being transported to an unapproved destination.

Using the CA API Gateway - Policy Manager, when creating polices to meet this requirement, the policies should be configured to leverage attributes from the ${request} variable, which contains information about the requesting client's IP address and identity, as well as message headers and body (content) that make up the request.

Some of these functions and services are installed and enabled by default. The organization must determine which functions and services are required to perform the content filtering and other necessary core functionality for each component of the ALG. These unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may remain unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by providing additional attack vectors.

The primary function of an ALG is to provide application-specific content filtering and/or proxy services. The ALG application suite may integrate related content filtering and analysis services and tools (e.g., IPS, proxy, malware inspection, black/white lists). Some gateways may also include email scanning, decryption, caching, and DLP services. However, services and capabilities that are unrelated to this primary functionality must not be installed (e.g., DNS, email client or server, FTP server, or web server).

Next Generation ALGs (NGFW) and Unified Threat Management (UTM) ALGs integrate functions that have traditionally been separated. These products integrate content filtering features to provide more granular policy filtering. There may be operational drawbacks to combining these services into one device. Another issue is that NGFW and UTM products vary greatly, with no current definitive industry standard.

ALGs are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations. DoD continually assesses the ports, protocols, and services that can be used for network communications. Some ports, protocols, or services have known exploits or security weaknesses.

The ALG is a key network element for preventing these non-compliant ports, protocols, and services from causing harm to DoD information systems.

The CA API Gateway must be configured to prevent or restrict the use of prohibited ports, protocols, and services throughout the network by filtering the network traffic and disallowing or redirecting traffic as necessary.

Multifactor authentication uses two or more factors to achieve authentication. Factors include: 

1) Something you know (e.g., password/PIN), 
2) Something you have (e.g., cryptographic, identification device, token), and 
3) Something you are (e.g., biometric).

Non-privileged accounts are not authorized access to the network element regardless of access method.

Network access is any access to an application by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) where said access is obtained through a network connection.

Authenticating with a PKI credential and entering the associated PIN is an example of multifactor authentication.

The CA API Gateway supports X.509, username/password, SAML, Kerberos, and RADIUS authentication. To provide multifactor authentication, the CA API Gateway must include a policy that uses multiple authentication assertions and include a route assertion that routes to a biometric back-end service and then evaluate the response to allow/disallow access to the Registered Service.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target CA API Gateway ALG</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>CA API Gateway ALG</dc:subject><dc:identifier>3049</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-000766</ident><fixtext fixref="F-77665r1_fix">Open the CA API Gateway - Policy Manager.

If the network does not provide safeguards against DoS attack, network resources will be unavailable to users.

Installation of an ALG at key boundaries in the architecture mitigates the risk of DoS attacks. These attacks can be detected by matching observed communications traffic with patterns of known attacks and monitoring for anomalies in traffic volume/type.

The ALG must include protection against DoS attacks that originate from inside the enclave, which can affect either internal or external systems. These attacks may use legitimate or rogue endpoints from inside the enclave. These attacks can be simple "floods" of traffic to saturate circuits or devices, malware that consumes CPU and memory on a device or causes it to crash, or a configuration issue that disables or impairs the proper function of a device. For example, an accidental or deliberate misconfiguration of a routing table can misdirect traffic for multiple networks.

To comply with this requirement, the ALG must monitor outbound traffic for indications of known and unknown DoS attacks. Audit log capacity management, along with techniques that prevent the logging of redundant information during an attack, also guard against DoS attacks.

The CA API Gateway must enable an inbound rate limit in an effort to provide safeguards against DoS attacks. By default, this is not turned on and will need to be enabled either in Global Policy or within each Registered Service.

To protect authenticity of communications sessions, the CA API Gateway includes the "Require SSL or TLS Transport with Client Certificate Authentication" Assertion which includes options for Mutual Authentication such as requiring the client initiating the communication to authenticate with a trusted certificate. The CA API Gateway must utilize this assertion within Registered services or within Global policy to help create protection against man-in-the-middle attacks/session hijacking and the insertion of false information into a session allowing both the client and destination server to trust and authenticate against each other before communications can occur.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target CA API Gateway ALG</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>CA API Gateway ALG</dc:subject><dc:identifier>3049</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-001184</ident><fixtext fixref="F-77679r1_fix">Open the CA API Gateway - Policy Manager and double-click any of the Registered Services that do not have the "Require SSL or TLS Transport with Client Certificate Authentication" Assertion.

This requirement limits the ability of adversaries from capturing and continuing to employ previously valid session IDs.

Session IDs are tokens generated by web applications to uniquely identify an application user's session. Unique session identifiers or IDs are the opposite of sequentially generated session IDs, which can be easily guessed by an attacker. Unique session IDs help to reduce predictability of said identifiers. When a user logs out, or when any other session termination event occurs, the network element must terminate the user session to minimize the potential for an attacker to hijack that particular user session.

ALGs act as an intermediary for applications; therefore, session control is part of the function provided. This requirement focuses on communications protection at the application session, rather than at the network packet level.

The ALG generates an alert that notifies designated personnel of the Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) that require real-time alerts. These messages should include a severity-level indicator or code as an indicator of the criticality of the incident. These indicators reflect the occurrence of a compromise or a potential compromise.

Since these incidents require immediate action, these messages are assigned a critical or level 1 priority/severity, depending on the system's priority schema.

CJCSM 6510.01B, "Cyber Incident Handling Program", lists nine Cyber Incident and Reportable Event Categories. DoD has determined that categories identified by CJCSM 6510.01B Major Indicators (category 1, 2, 4, or 7 detection events) will require an alert when an event is detected.

Alerts may be transmitted, for example, telephonically, by electronic mail messages, or by text messaging. The ALG must either send the alert to a management console that is actively monitored by authorized personnel or use a messaging capability to send the alert directly to designated personnel.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target CA API Gateway ALG</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>CA API Gateway ALG</dc:subject><dc:identifier>3049</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-002664</ident><fixtext fixref="F-77781r1_fix">Open the CA API Gateway - Policy Manager and double-click any of the Registered Services that require an alert to be sent when malicious code/malware is detected.

This results in unanticipated application behavior, potentially leading to an application or information system compromise. Invalid input is one of the primary methods employed when attempting to compromise an application.

Network devices with the functionality to perform application layer inspection may be leveraged to validate data content of network communications. Checking the valid syntax and semantics of information system inputs (e.g., character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values) verifies that inputs match specified definitions for format and content. Software typically follows well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control information. If network elements use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives the tainted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly. Pre-screening inputs prior to passing to interpreters prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation helps to ensure accurate and correct inputs and prevent attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.

The CA API Gateway must validate both XML and JSON schemas to verify valid inputs from a client requesting Registered Services. This helps to prevent against XDoS attacks and parameter tampering, which in turn helps to prevent the injection of malicious scripts or content into the request.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target CA API Gateway ALG</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>CA API Gateway ALG</dc:subject><dc:identifier>3049</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-001310</ident><fixtext fixref="F-77785r1_fix">Open the CA API Gateway - Policy Manager and double-click each of the Registered Services required to validate inputs that do not include a "Validate XML Schema" or Validate JSON Schema" Assertion.

A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user access) without terminating network sessions.

Session termination terminates all processes associated with a user's logical session, except those processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated.

This capability is typically reserved for specific system functionality where the system owner, data owner, or organization requires additional trigger events based on specific mission needs. Conditions or trigger events requiring automatic session termination can include, for example, targeted responses to certain types of incidents and time-of-day restrictions on information system use.
