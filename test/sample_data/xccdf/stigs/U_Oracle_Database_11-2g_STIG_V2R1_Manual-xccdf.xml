      <title>Access to default accounts used to support replication must be restricted to authorized DBAs.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Replication database accounts are used for database connections between databases. Replication requires the configuration of these accounts using the same username and password on all databases participating in the replication. Replication connections use fixed user database links. This means that access to the replication account on one server provides access to the other servers participating in the replication. Granting unauthorized access to the replication account provides unauthorized and privileged access to all databases participating in the replication group.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

DoD guidance recommends:

OR

2b. Each control file is to be located on separate, archived directories within one or more RAID devices

      <title>The Oracle SQL92_SECURITY parameter must be set to TRUE.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;The configuration option SQL92_SECURITY specifies whether table-level SELECT privileges are required to execute an update or delete that references table column values. If this option is disabled (set to FALSE), the UPDATE privilege can be used to determine values that should require SELECT privileges.

The SQL92_SECURITY setting of TRUE prevents the exploitation of user credentials with only DELETE or UPDATE privileges on a table from being able to derive column values in that table by performing a series of update/delete statements using a where clause, and rolling back the change. In the following example, with SQL92_SECURITY set to FALSE, a user with only delete privilege on the scott.emp table is able to derive that there is one employee with a salary greater than 3000. With SQL92_SECURITY set to TRUE, that user is prevented from attempting to derive a value.

SQL92_SECURITY = FALSE
SQL&gt; delete from scott.emp where sal &gt; 3000;

SQL92_SECURITY = TRUE

Determine all Listeners running on the host.

For Windows hosts, view all Windows services with TNSListener embedded in the service name
- The service name format is:
  Oracle[ORACLE_HOME_NAME]TNSListener

For UNIX hosts, the Oracle Listener process will indicate the TNSLSNR executable.

At a command prompt, issue the command:
ps -ef | grep tnslsnr | grep -v grep

The alias for the listener follows tnslsnr in the command output.

You must be logged on the host system using the account that owns the tnslsnr executable (UNIX). If the account is denied local login, have the system SA assist you in this task by 'su' to the listener account from the root account. On Windows platforms, log in using an account with administrator privileges to complete the check.

From a system command prompt, execute the listener control utility:

lsnrctl status [LISTENER NAME]

Review the results for the value of Security.

If Security = OFF is displayed, this is a Finding.

If Security = ON: Local OS Authentication is displayed, this is not a Finding.

If Security = ON: Password or Local OS Authentication, this is a Finding (do not set a password on Oracle versions 10.1 and higher. Instead, use Local OS Authentication).

Repeat the execution of the lsnrctl utility for all active listeners.</check-content>

      <fixtext fixref="F-21460r307058_fix">For UNIX Systems:

Set the umask of the Oracle software owner account to 022. Determine the shell being used for the Oracle software owner account:

env | grep -i shell

Startup files for each shell are as follows (located in users $HOME directory):

C-Shell (CSH) = .cshrc
Bourne Shell (SH) = .profile
Korn Shell (KSH) = .kshrc
TC Shell (TCS) = .tcshrc
BASH Shell = .bash_profile or .bashrc

Edit the shell startup file for the account and add or modify the line:

umask 022

Log off and login, then enter the umask command to confirm the setting.

NOTE: To effect this change for all Oracle processes, a reboot of the DBMS server may be required.

For Windows Systems:
Product-specific fix is pending development. Use Generic Fix listed below:

Restrict access to the DBMS software libraries to the fewest accounts that clearly require access based on job function.

Document authorized access control and justify any access grants that do not fall under DBA, DBMS process, ownership, or SA accounts.</fixtext>

        <check-content>For UNIX Systems:

Log in using the Oracle software owner account and enter the command:

umask

If the value returned is 022 or more restrictive, this is not a Finding.

If the value returned is less restrictive than 022, this is a Finding.

The first number sets the mask for user/owner file permissions. The second number sets the mask for group file permissions. The third number sets file permission mask for other users. The list below shows the available settings:

0 = read/write/execute
1 = read/write
2 = read/execute
3 = read
4 = write/execute
5 = write
6 = execute
7 = no permissions

Setting the umask to 022 effectively sets files for user/owner to read/write, group to read and other to read. Directories are set for user/owner to read/write/execute, group to read/execute and other to read/execute.

For Windows Systems:
Review the permissions that control access to the Oracle installation software directories (e.g. \Program Files\Oracle\).

DBA accounts, the DBMS process account, the DBMS software installation/maintenance account, SA accounts if access by them is required for some operational level of support such as backups, and the host system itself require access.

Compare the access control employed with that documented in the System Security Plan.

If access controls do not match the documented requirement, this is a Finding.

If access controls appear excessive without justification, this is a Finding.</check-content>

        <check-content>IP address restriction may be defined for the database listener, by use of the Oracle Connection Manager or by an external network device.

Identify the method used to enforce address restriction (interview or System Security Plan review).

If enforced by the database listener, then review the SQLNET.ORA file located in the ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory (note: this assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in the default location, is in use; please see the supplemental file "Non-default sqlnet.ora configurations.pdf" for how to find multiple and/or differently located sqlnet.ora files) or the directory indicated by the TNS_ADMIN environment variable or registry setting.

If the following entries do not exist, then restriction by IP address is not configured and is a Finding.
tcp.validnode_checking=YES
tcp.invited_nodes=(IP1, IP2, IP3)

If enforced by an Oracle Connection Manager, then review the CMAN.ORA file for the Connection Manager (located in the TNS_ADMIN or ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory for the connection manager).

If a RULE entry allows all addresses ("/32") or does not match the address range specified in the System Security Plan, this is a Finding.

(rule=(src=[IP]/27)(dst=[IP])(srv=*)(act=accept))

NOTE: an IP address with a "/" indicates acceptance by subnet mask where the number after the "/" is the left most number of bits in the address that must match for the rule to apply.

If this rule is database-specific, then determine if the SERVICE_NAME parameter is set:

From SQL*PLUS:

select value from v$parameter where name = 'service_names';

If SERVICE_NAME is set in the initialization file for the database instance, use (srv=[service name]), else, use (srv=*) if not set or rule applies to all databases on the DBMS server.

If network access restriction is performed by an external device, validate ACLs are in place to prohibit unauthorized access to the DBMS.  To do this, find the IP address of the database server (destination address) and source address (authorized IPs) in the System Security Plan.  Confirm only authorized IPs from the System Security Plan are allowed access to the DBMS.</check-content>

      <title>The DBMS, when using PKI-based authentication, must enforce authorized access to the corresponding private key.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;The cornerstone of the PKI is the private key used to encrypt or digitally sign information.

If the private key is stolen, this will lead to the compromise of the authentication and non-repudiation gained through PKI because the attacker can use the private key to digitally sign documents and can pretend to be the authorized user.

Both the holders of a digital certificate and the issuing authority must protect the computers, storage devices, or whatever they use to keep the private keys.

All access to the private key of the DBMS must be restricted to authorized and authenticated users. If unauthorized users have access to the DBMS's private key, an attacker could gain access to the primary key and use it to impersonate the database on the network.

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the successor protocol to Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).

      <title>The DBMS must limit the number of concurrent sessions for each system account to an organization-defined number of sessions.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Application management includes the ability to control the number of users and user sessions utilizing an application. Limiting the number of allowed users, and sessions per user, is helpful in limiting risks related to Denial of Service attacks.

This requirement addresses concurrent session control for a single information system account and does not address concurrent sessions by a single user via multiple system accounts. 

Unlimited concurrent connections to the DBMS could allow a successful Denial of Service (DoS) attack by exhausting connection resources.

The organization will need to define the maximum number of concurrent sessions by account type, by account, or a combination thereof.  In deciding on the appropriate number, it is important to take into account the work requirements of the various types of user.  For example, 2 might be an acceptable limit for general users accessing the database via an application; but 10 might be too few for a database administrator using a database management GUI tool, where each query tab and navigation pane may count as a separate session.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <title>The system must employ automated mechanisms for supporting Oracle user account management.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;A comprehensive application account management process that includes automation helps to ensure accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed. Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended, or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores, such as multiple servers.

Enterprise environments make application user account management challenging and complex.  A user management process requiring administrators to manually address account management functions adds risk of potential oversight.

Automated mechanisms may be comprised of differing technologies that when placed together contain an overall automated mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements.

Databases can have large numbers of users in disparate locations and job functions.  Automatic account management can help mitigate the risk of human error found in manually managing database access.

Note that user authentication and account management should be done via an enterprise-wide mechanism whenever possible.  Examples of enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Active Directory and LDAP  This requirement applies to cases where it is necessary to have accounts directly managed by Oracle.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

Roles and Profiles are two Oracle features that should be employed in account management. (Indeed, other requirements mandate the use of Roles.) Following are some notes from Oracle on the use of Profiles.

A profile is a named set of resource limits and password parameters that restrict database usage and instance resources for a user. You can assign a profile to each user, and a default profile to all others. Each user can have only one profile, and creating a new one supersedes any earlier one.

Profile resource limits are enforced only when you enable resource limitation for the associated database. Enabling such limitation can occur either before starting up the database (the RESOURCE_LIMIT initialization parameter) or while it is open (using an ALTER SYSTEM statement).

While password parameters reside in profiles, they are unaffected by RESOURCE_LIMIT or ALTER SYSTEM and password management is always enabled.</fixtext>

      <title>The DBMS must enforce approved authorizations for logical access to the system in accordance with applicable policy.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Strong access controls are critical to securing application data. Access control policies (e.g., identity-based policies, role-based policies, attribute-based policies) and access enforcement mechanisms (e.g., access control lists, access control matrices, cryptography) must be employed by applications, when applicable, to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, domains) in the information system. 

Consideration should be given to the implementation of an audited, explicit override of automated mechanisms in the event of emergencies or other serious events.

If the DBMS does not follow applicable policy when approving access it may be in conflict with networks or other applications in the information system. This may result in users either gaining or being denied access inappropriately and may be in conflict with applicable policy.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system. (e.g., network interface, hard disk, modem, etc.). From an application perspective, certain specific application functionalities may be audited as well.

The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is capable of generating audit records (i.e., auditable events, timestamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked).

Organizations define which application components shall provide auditable events. 

The DBMS must provide auditing for the list of events defined by the organization or risk negatively impacting forensic investigations into malicious behavior in the information system. Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system, such as network interfaces, hard disks, modems, etc. From an application perspective, certain specific application functionalities may be audited, as well.

The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is capable of generating audit records (i.e., auditable events, timestamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked).

Organizations may define the organizational personnel accountable for determining which application components shall provide auditable events.

Auditing provides accountability for changes made to the DBMS configuration or its objects and data. It provides a means to discover suspicious activity and unauthorized changes. Without auditing, a compromise may go undetected and without a means to determine accountability.

The Department of Defense has established the following as the minimum set of auditable events.  Most can be audited via Oracle settings; some may require OS settings.

- Successful and unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete privileges, security objects, security levels, or categories of information (e.g. classification levels). 

- Successful and unsuccessful logon attempts, privileged activities or other system level access

- Starting and ending time for user access to the system, concurrent logons from different workstations.

- Successful and unsuccessful accesses to objects.

- All program initiations.

      <title>The DBMS must generate audit records for the DoD-selected list of auditable events, to the extent such information is available.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system, such as network interfaces, hard disks, modems, etc. From an application perspective, certain specific application functionalities may be audited, as well.

The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is capable of generating audit records (i.e., auditable events, timestamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked).

Organizations may define the organizational personnel accountable for determining which application components shall provide auditable events.

Auditing provides accountability for changes made to the DBMS configuration or its objects and data. It provides a means to discover suspicious activity and unauthorized changes. Without auditing, a compromise may go undetected and without a means to determine accountability.

The Department of Defense has established the following as the minimum set of auditable events.  Most can be audited via Oracle settings; some may require OS settings.

- Successful and unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete privileges, security objects, security levels, or categories of information (e.g. classification levels). 

- Successful and unsuccessful logon attempts, privileged activities or other system level access

- Starting and ending time for user access to the system, concurrent logons from different workstations.

- Successful and unsuccessful accesses to objects.

- All program initiations.

- All direct access to the information system.

- All account creations, modifications, disabling, and terminations. 

- All kernel module loads, unloads, and restarts.  &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

Additionally, applications with user interfaces to audit records must not allow for the unfettered manipulation of or access to those records via the application. If the application provides access to the audit data, the application becomes accountable for ensuring that audit information is protected from unauthorized access.

Modification of database audit data could mask the theft of, or the unauthorized modification of, sensitive data stored in the database.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

Revoke access to the AUD$ table to anyone who you do not want to have access to the AUD$ table.

In the check we looked for all users who had access to the AUD$ table. To fix this, use the REVOKE command to revoke access to users who should not have access to the audit data.

REVOKE statement

Use the REVOKE statement to remove permissions from a specific user or from all users to perform actions on database objects.
The following types of permissions can be revoked:
    Delete data from a specific table.
    Insert data into a specific table.
    Create a foreign key reference to the named table or to a subset of columns from a table.
    Select data from a table, view, or a subset of columns in a table.
    Create a trigger on a table.
    Update data in a table or in a subset of columns in a table.
    Run a specified routine (function or procedure).

If a user named FRED had access to the AUD$ table and you want to revoke that access, use the following command. The syntax that you use for the REVOKE statement for tables is as follows:

REVOKE privilege-type ON [ TABLE ] { table-Name | view-Name } FROM grantees


SQL&gt;REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE AUD$ FROM FRED; 

Revoking a privilege without specifying a column list revokes the privilege for all of the columns in the table.
Syntax for routines

table-privileges include

  DELETE |
  INSERT |
  REFERENCES [column list] |
  SELECT [column list] |
  TRIGGER |
  UPDATE [column list] 

column list

  ( column-identifier {, column-identifier}* ) 

Use the ALL PRIVILEGES privilege type to revoke all of the permissions from the user for the specified table. You can also revoke one or more table privileges by specifying a privilege-list.

Use the DELETE privilege type to revoke permission to delete rows from the specified table.

Use the INSERT privilege type to revoke permission to insert rows into the specified table.

Use the REFERENCES privilege type to revoke permission to create a foreign key reference to the specified table. If a column list is specified with the REFERENCES privilege, the permission is revoked on only the foreign key reference to the specified columns.

Use the SELECT privilege type to revoke permission to perform SELECT statements on a table or view. If a column list is specified with the SELECT privilege, the permission is revoked on only those columns. If no column list is specified, then the privilege is valid on all of the columns in the table.

Use the TRIGGER privilege type to revoke permission to create a trigger on the specified table.

Use the UPDATE privilege type to revoke permission to use the UPDATE statement on the specified table. If a column list is specified, the permission is revoked only on the specified columns.
grantees

  { authorization ID | PUBLIC } [,{ authorization ID | PUBLIC } ] *

You can revoke the privileges from specific users or from all users. Use the keyword PUBLIC to specify all users. The privileges revoked from PUBLIC and from individual users are independent privileges. For example, a SELECT privilege on table t is granted to both PUBLIC and to the authorization ID harry. The SELECT privilege is later revoked from the authorization ID 'Harry', but the authorization ID 'Harry' can access the table through the PUBLIC privilege.

Restriction: You cannot revoke the privileges of the owner of an object.

Cascading object dependencies

For views, triggers, and constraints, if the privilege on which the object depends on is revoked, the object is automatically dropped. Derby does not try to determine if you have other privileges that can replace the privileges that are being revoked. For more information, see "SQL standard authorization" in the Java DB Developer's Guide.
Limitations

The following limitations apply to the REVOKE statement:

Table-level privileges
    All of the table-level privilege types for a specified grantee and table ID are stored in one row in the SYSTABLEPERMS system table. For example, when user2 is granted the SELECT and DELETE privileges on table user1.t1, a row is added to the SYSTABLEPERMS table. The GRANTEE field contains user2 and the TABLEID contains user1.t1. The SELECTPRIV and DELETEPRIV fields are set to Y. The remaining privilege type fields are set to N.

    When a grantee creates an object that relies on one of the privilege types, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the object on the specific row in the SYSTABLEPERMS table. For example, user2 creates the view v1 by using the statement SELECT * FROM user1.t1; the dependency manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1). The dependency manager knows only that the view is dependent on a privilege type in that specific row but does not track exactly which privilege type the view is dependent on.

    When a REVOKE statement for a table-level privilege is issued for a grantee and table ID, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee and table ID are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the DELETE privilege on table t1 from user2, the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1) is modified by the REVOKE statement. The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the DELETE privilege for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1).

Column-level privileges
    Only one type of privilege for a specified grantee and table ID are stored in one row in the SYSCOLPERMS system table. For example, when user2 is granted the SELECT privilege on table user1.t1 for columns c12 and c13, a row is added to the SYSCOLPERMS. The GRANTEE field contains user2, the TABLEID contains user1.t1, the TYPE field contains S, and the COLUMNS field contains c12, c13.

    When a grantee creates an object that relies on the privilege type and the subset of columns in a table ID, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the object on the specific row in the SYSCOLPERMS table. For example, user2 creates the view v1 by using the statement SELECT c11 FROM user1.t1; the dependency manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSCOLPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S). The dependency manager knows that the view is dependent on the SELECT privilege type but does not track exactly which columns the view is dependent on.

    When a REVOKE statement for a column-level privilege is issued for a grantee, table ID, and type, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee, table ID, and type are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the SELECT privilege on column c12 on table user1.t1 from user2, the row in SYSCOLPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S) is modified by the REVOKE statement. The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the column c12 for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S).

Revoke examples
To revoke the SELECT privilege on table t from the authorization IDs 'Maria' and 'Harry', use the following syntax:

SQL&gt;REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE t FROM maria,harry 

To revoke the UPDATE and TRIGGER privileges on table t from the authorization IDs 'Anita' and 'Zhi', use the following syntax:

SQL&gt;REVOKE UPDATE, TRIGGER ON TABLE t FROM anita,zhi 

To revoke the SELECT privilege on table s.v from all users, use the following syntax:

SQL&gt;REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE s.v FROM PUBLIC

To revoke the UPDATE privilege on columns c1 and c2 of table s.v from all users, use the following syntax:

SQL&gt;REVOKE UPDATE (c1,c2) ON TABLE s.v FROM PUBLIC

To revoke the EXECUTE privilege on procedure p from the authorization ID 'George', use the following syntax:
SQL&gt;REVOKE EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE p FROM george RESTRICT</fixtext>

      <title>The DBMS must protect audit information from unauthorized deletion.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;If audit data were to become compromised, then competent forensic analysis and discovery of the true source of potentially malicious system activity is impossible to achieve. 

To ensure the veracity of audit data the information system and/or the application must protect audit information from unauthorized deletion. This requirement can be achieved through multiple methods which will depend upon system architecture and design.  

Some commonly employed methods include:  ensuring log files enjoy the proper file system permissions utilizing file system protections; restricting access; and backing up log data to ensure log data is retained.  

Applications providing a user interface to audit data will leverage user permissions and roles identifying the user accessing the data and the corresponding rights the user enjoys in order make access decisions regarding the deletion of audit data.

Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity.

The SELECTPRIV and DELETEPRIV fields are set to Y. The remaining privilege type fields are set to N.

    When a grantee creates an object that relies on one of the privilege types, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the object on the specific row in the SYSTABLEPERMS table. For example, user2 creates the view v1 by using the statement SELECT * FROM user1.t1; the dependency manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1). The dependency manager knows only that the view is dependent on a privilege type in that specific row but does not track exactly which privilege type the view is dependent on.

    When a REVOKE statement for a table-level privilege is issued for a grantee and table ID, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee and table ID are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the DELETE privilege on table t1 from user2, the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1) is modified by the REVOKE statement. The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the DELETE privilege for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1).

Column-level privileges

For example, when user2 is granted the SELECT privilege on table user1.t1 for columns c12 and c13, a row is added to the SYSCOLPERMS.

      <title>The DBMS must protect audit tools from unauthorized deletion.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Protecting audit data also includes identifying and protecting the tools used to view and manipulate log data. 

Depending upon the log format and application, system and application log tools may provide the only means to manipulate and manage application and system log data. 

It is, therefore, imperative that access to audit tools be controlled and protected from unauthorized access.  

Applications providing tools to interface with audit data will leverage user permissions and roles identifying the user accessing the tools and the corresponding rights the user enjoys in order make access decisions regarding the access to audit tools.

Audit tools include, but are not limited to, OS-provided audit tools, vendor-provided audit tools, and open source audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information system activity and records. 

If an attacker were to gain access to audit tools, he could analyze audit logs for system weaknesses or weaknesses in the auditing itself.  An attacker could also manipulate logs to hide evidence of malicious activity.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

As of Oracle version 11.1, the external procedure agent may be run directly from the database and not require use of the Oracle listener. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access to the procedure from outside of the database process.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <fixtext fixref="F-21496r307166_fix">If the use of external procedure agent is required, then authorize and document the requirement in the System Security Plan.

If the external procedure agent must be accessible to the Oracle listener, then specify this and authorize it in the System Security Plan.

If use of the Oracle External Procedure agent is not required:

- Stop the Oracle Listener process
- Remove all references to extproc in the listener.ora and tnsnames.ora files
- Alter the permissions on the executable files:

UNIX - Remove read/write/execute permissions from owner, group and world
Windows - Remove Groups/Users from the executable (except groups SYSTEM and ADMINISTRATORS) and allow READ [only] for SYSTEM and ADMINISTRATORS groups

If required:

- Restrict extproc execution to only authorized applications.
- Specify EXTPROC_DLLS=ONLY: [list of authorized DLLS] in the extproc.ora and the listener.ora files
- Create a separate, dedicated listener for use by the external procedure agent

Review the ORACLE_HOME/bin directory or search the ORACLE_BASE path for the executable extproc (UNIX) or extproc.exe (Windows).

If external procedure agent is not authorized for use in the System Security Plan and the executable file does not exist or is restricted, this is not a finding.

If external procedure agent is not authorized for use in the System Security Plan and the executable file exists and is not restricted, this is a finding.

If use of the external procedure agent is authorized, ensure extproc is restricted to execution of authorized applications.

External jobs are run using the account nobody by default.

Review the contents of the file ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/externaljob.ora for the lines run_user= and run_group=.

If the user assigned to these parameters is not "nobody", this is a finding.

For versions 11.1 and later, the external procedure agent (extproc executable) is available directly from the database and does not require definition in the listener.ora file for use.

Review the contents of the file ORACLE_HOME/hs/admin/extproc.ora.

If external processes are allowed, but the file does not exist, this is a finding.

If the following entry does not appear in the file, this is a finding:

EXTPROC_DLLS=ONLY:[dll full file name1]:[dll full file name2]:..

[dll full file name] represents a full path and file name.

This list of file names is separated by ":".

If "ONLY" is specified, then the list is restricted to allow execution of only the DLLs specified in the list and is not a finding.

If "ANY" is specified, then there are no restrictions for execution except what is controlled by operating system permissions and is a finding.

If no specification is made, any files located in the %ORACLE_HOME%\bin directory on Windows systems or $ORACLE_HOME/lib directory on UNIX systems can be executed (the default) and is a finding.

Ensure that EXTPROC is not accessible from the listener.

Review the listener.ora file. If any entries reference "extproc", this is a finding.

Determine if the external procedure agent is in use per Oracle 10.x conventions.

The following are notes on implementing a Secure External Password Store using Oracle Wallet:

Oracle provides the capability to provide for a secure external password facility.  Use the Oracle mkstore to create a secure storage area for passwords for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use, or deploy a site-authorized facility to perform this function.

Check to see what has been stored in the Oracle External Password Store.

To view all contents of a client wallet external password store, check specific credentials by viewing them. Listing the external password store contents provides information you can use to decide whether to add or delete credentials from the store.  To list the contents of the external password store, enter the following command at the command line:

$ mkstore -wrl wallet_location -listCredential
For example:
$ mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\11.2.0\db_1\wallets -listCredential

The wallet_location specifies the path to the directory where the wallet, whose external password store contents you want to view, is located. This command lists all of the credential database service names (aliases) and the corresponding user name (schema) for that database. Passwords are not listed.

Configuring Clients to use the External Password Store:

If your client is already configured to use external authentication, such as Windows native authentication or Transport Layer Security (TLS), then Oracle Database uses that authentication method. The same credentials used for this type of authentication are typically also used to log in to the database.

For clients not using such authentication methods or wanting to override them for database authentication, you can set the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter in sqlnet.ora to TRUE. The default value for SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE is FALSE, allowing standard use of authentication credentials as before.

If you want a client to use the secure external password store feature, then perform the following configuration task:

1. Create a wallet on the client by using the following syntax at the command line:

mkstore -wrl wallet_location -create

For example:

mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\11.2.0\db_1\wallets -create

Enter password: password

The wallet_location is the path to the directory where you want to create and store the wallet. This command creates an Oracle wallet with the autologin feature enabled at the location you specify. The autologin feature enables the client to access the wallet contents without supplying a password. 
 
The mkstore utility -create option uses password complexity verification.
 
2. Create database connection credentials in the wallet by using the following syntax at the command line:

mkstore -wrl wallet_location -createCredential db_connect_string username

Enter password: password

For example:
mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\11.2.0\db_1\wallets -createCredential oracle system

Enter password: password

In this specification the wallet_location is the path to the directory where you created the wallet.  The db_connect_string used in the CONNECT /@db_connect_string statement must be identical to the db_connect_string specified in the -createCredential command.  The db_connect_string is the TNS alias you use to specify the database in the tnsnames.ora file or any service name you use to identify the database on an Oracle network. By default, tnsnames.ora is located in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory on UNIX systems and in ORACLE_HOME\network\admin on Windows.  The username is the database logon credential. When prompted, enter the password for this user.
 
 3. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the WALLET_LOCATION parameter and set it to the directory location of the wallet you created in Step 1.  For example, if you created the wallet in $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin and your Oracle home is set to /private/ora11, then you need to enter the following into your client sqlnet.ora file:

    WALLET_LOCATION =
           (SOURCE =
             (METHOD = FILE)
             (METHOD_DATA =
           (DIRECTORY = /private/ora11/network/admin)
           )
          )
 
4. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter and set it to TRUE as follows:

SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE

This setting causes all CONNECT /@db_connect_string statements to use the information in the wallet at the specified location to authenticate to databases.

When external authentication is in use, an authenticated user with such a wallet can use the CONNECT /@db_connect_string syntax to access the previously specified databases without providing a user name and password. However, if a user fails that external authentication, then these connect statements also fail.

Below is a sample sqlnet.ora file with the WALLET_LOCATION and the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameters set as described in Steps 3 and 4.

        WALLET_LOCATION =
            (SOURCE =
              (METHOD = FILE)
              (METHOD_DATA =
            (DIRECTORY = /private/ora11/network/admin)
              )
             )
        SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE
        SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = FALSE
        SSL_VERSION = 1.2

(Note: This assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in the default location, is in use. Please see the supplemental file "Non-default sqlnet.ora configurations.pdf" for how to find multiple and/or differently located sqlnet.ora files.)</fixtext>

Ask the DBA/SA/Application Support staff if they have created an external password store for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use.  Verify that all passwords stored there are encrypted.  If a password store is used and any password is not encrypted, this is a finding.


The following are notes on implementing a Secure External Password Store using Oracle Wallet:

You can store password credentials for connecting to databases by using a client-side Oracle wallet. An Oracle wallet is a secure software container that stores authentication and signing credentials.

This wallet usage can simplify large-scale deployments that rely on password credentials for connecting to databases. When this feature is configured, application code, batch jobs, and scripts  no longer need embedded user names and passwords. This reduces risk because the passwords are no longer exposed, and password management policies are more easily enforced without changing application code whenever user names or passwords change.
  
The external password store of the wallet is separate from the area where public key infrastructure (PKI) credentials are stored. Consequently, you cannot use Oracle Wallet Manager to manage credentials in the external password store of the wallet. Instead, use the command-line utility mkstore to manage these credentials.
  
How Does the External Password Store Work?

Typically, users (and applications, batch jobs, and scripts) connect to databases by using a standard CONNECT statement that specifies a database connection string. This string can include a user name and password, and an Oracle Net service name identifying the database on an Oracle Database network. If the password is omitted, the connection prompts the user for the password.

For example, the service name could be the URL that identifies that database, or a TNS alias you entered in the tnsnames.ora file in the database. Another possibility is a host:port:sid string.
  
The following examples are standard CONNECT statements that could be used for a client that is not configured to use the external password store:

  CONNECT salesapp@sales_db.us.example.com
  Enter password: password

  CONNECT salesapp@orasales
  Enter password: password

  CONNECT salesapp@ourhost37:1527:DB17
  Enter password: password

In these examples, salesapp is the user name, with the unique connection string for the database shown as specified in three different ways. You could use its URL sales_db.us.example.com, or its TNS alias, orasales, from the tnsnames.ora file, or its host:port:sid string.

However, when clients are configured to use the secure external password store, applications can connect to a database with the following CONNECT statement syntax, without specifying database logon credentials:

  CONNECT /@db_connect_string

  CONNECT /@db_connect_string AS SYSDBA

  CONNECT /@db_connect_string AS SYSOPER
  
In this specification, db_connect_string is a valid connection string to access the intended database, such as the service name, URL, or alias as shown in the earlier examples. Each user account must have its own unique connection string; you cannot create one connection string for multiple users.

In this case, the database credentials, user name and password, are securely stored in an Oracle wallet created for this purpose. The autologin feature of this wallet is turned on, so the system does not need a password to open the wallet. From the wallet, it gets the credentials to access the database for the user they represent.</check-content>

      <title>The DBMS, when utilizing PKI-based authentication, must validate certificates by constructing a certification path with status information to an accepted trust anchor.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public key and associated data. It is used in the context of public key infrastructures, X.509 digital certificates, and DNSSEC. 

When there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor; it can be for example a Certification Authority (CA). A certification path starts with the Subject certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted root certificate, typically issued by a trusted CA. 

Path validation is necessary for a relying party to make an informed trust decision when presented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted.  

Status information for certification paths includes certificate revocation lists or online certificate status protocol responses. 

Database Management Systems that do not validate certificates to a trust anchor are in danger of accepting certificates that are invalid and/or counterfeit. This could allow unauthorized access to the database.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

The database supports PKI-based authentication by using digital certificates over TLS in addition to the native encryption and data integrity capabilities of these protocols.

Oracle provides a complete PKI that is based on RSA Security, Inc., Public-Key Cryptography Standards, and which interoperates with Oracle servers and clients.  The database uses a wallet which is a container that is used to store authentication and signing credentials, including private keys, certificates, and trusted certificates needed by TLS. In an Oracle environment, every entity that communicates over TLS must have a wallet containing an X.509 version 3 certificate, private key, and list of trusted certificates.  Security administrators use Oracle Wallet Manager to manage security credentials on the server.

If the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/sqlnet.ora contains the following entries, TLS is installed.

      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;This requirement focuses on communications protection at the application session, versus network packet, level. 

Session IDs are tokens generated by web applications to uniquely identify an application user's session.   Applications will make application decisions and execute business logic based on the session ID. Unique session identifiers or IDs are the opposite of sequentially generated session IDs, which can be easily guessed by an attacker. Unique session IDs help to reduce predictability of said identifiers. Unique session IDs address man-in-the-middle attacks, including session hijacking or insertion of false information into a session. If the attackers are unable to identify or guess the session information related to pending application traffic, they will have more difficulty in hijacking the session or otherwise manipulating valid sessions. When a user logs out, or when any other session termination event occurs, the application must terminate the user session to minimize the potential for an attacker to hijack that particular user session.

Database sessions must be terminated when no longer in use in order to prevent session hijacking.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

- - - - -
To configure specific session termination processes we need to define the organization or policy-defined session termination event.  Below are some examples.

Oracle has several ways to disconnect idle sessions, both from within SQL*Plus via resources profiles (connect_time, idle_time) and with the SQL*net expire time parameter.

You can use profiles to set the connect time and idle time with "alter profile" statements:

alter profile senior_claim_analyst limit
   connect_time 180000
   sessions_per_user 2
   ldle_time 1800;

Profiles comprise a named set of resource limits. By default, when you create users, they are given the default profile, which provides unlimited use of all resources.

The syntax to create a profile follows:

CREATE PROFILE  LIMIT resource_parameters|password_parameters;
Resource_parameters: 
 [SESSIONS_PER_USER n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]
 [CPU_PER_SESSION   n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]    
 [CPU_PER_CALL      n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]           
 [CONNECT_TIME      n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]
 [IDLE_TIME         n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]

By setting resource limits, you can prevent users from performing operations that will tie up the system and prevent other users from performing operations. You can use resource limits for security, to ensure that users log off the system, so as not to leave the session connected for long periods of time.

The system resource limits can be enforced at the session-level, the call level, or both. The session-level is calculated from the time the user logs in to the database until the user exits. The call level applies to each SQL command issued. Session-level limits are enforced for each connection. When a session-level limit is exceeded, only the last SQL command issued is rolled back; no further work can be performed until a commit, rollback, or exit is performed.

Using SQLNET.EXPIRE_TIME

The sqlnet.expire_time parameter is used to set a time interval, in minutes, to determine how often a probe should be sent verifying that client/server connections are active. If you need to ensure that connections are not left open indefinitely (or up to the time set by operating system-specific parameters), you should set a value that is greater than 0. This protects the system from connections left open due to an abnormal client termination.

When the probe detects a terminated connection or a connection no longer in use, it signals an error, causing the server process to exit. This setting is intended for use on the database server side of the connection, which usually handles multiple connections at any one time. Limitations on using this terminated (dead) connection detection feature are:

sqlnet.expire_time cannot be used on bequeathed connections.     

The SQL*Net expire_time probe packet will generate additional network traffic that may downgrade the network's performance, depending on the number of connections.

Depending on the operating system that is in use, additional server processing may need to be performed to distinguish the connection probe from other events that occur. This overhead for detection of probe events can result in downgraded network performance.

Turning-on expire_time

To set up these advanced features, simply edit your sqlnet.ora file.  If you are a beginner, follow this procedure:

Start the Oracle Network Manager GUI.

In the GUI navigator pane, expand the icons Local &gt; Profile.
     
From the list on the right hand pane, select General.

Click on the Advanced tab.
     
Next, enter the values for the fields or options you want to set.  

When you are finished, choose File &gt; Save Network Configuration to write your changes to the sqlnet.ora file.

(Note: This assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in the default location, is in use.  Please see the supplemental file "Non-default sqlnet.ora configurations.pdf" for how to find multiple and/or differently located sqlnet.ora files.)

The sqlnet.ora inbound_connect_timeout parameter

The sqlnet.ora inbound_connect_timeout parameter is used to limit the time, set in seconds, for a client to connect with the database server and provide the required authentication information.

Also see sqlnet.inbound_connect_timeout tips.

To limit consumption of Oracle resources by unauthorized users and enable an audit trail, you should set time-limit values for the sqlnet.inbound_connect_timeout parameter in wall-clock seconds. (This parameter does not have default values.)  Failure resulting from sqlnet.inbound_connect_timeout will throw an ORA-03136 inbound connection timed out error.</fixtext>

Review system documentation and organization policy to identify other events that should result in session terminations. If other session termination events are defined, review DBMS settings to verify occurrences of these events would cause session termination. If occurrences of defined session-terminating events do not cause session terminations, this is a finding.

When a user logs out of an Oracle session gracefully or has the session terminated for an idle timeout or any other reason, the session is terminated, and the resources are returned to the system.  Check with the DBA to see what mechanism is used to disconnect the session and what events the site uses to determine if a connection needs to be terminated.  

To test for timeout, open a connection and leave it idle for a period greater than the defined idle timeout setting enforced by the system.  Then try to use the connection.  If the connection is no longer active, then the mechanism deployed to terminate the connection is active and working.</check-content>

Oracle recommends using Transparent Data Encryption to protect data. 

In order to check to see if the data is encrypted, for example, upon an auditor's request, Oracle provides views that document the encryption status of your database. For TDE column encryption, please use the view 'dba_encrypted_columns', which lists the owner, table name, column name, encryption algorithm, and salt, for all encrypted columns. For TDE tablespace encryption, the following SQL statement lists all encrypted tablespaces with their encryption algorithm and corresponding, encrypted, data files. Issue the following commands to check to see if the data at rest is encrypted.

$ sqlplus connect as sysdba

SQL&gt; SELECT t.name "TSName", 
e.encryptionalg "Algorithm", 
d.file_name "File Name" 
FROM v$tablespace t, 
v$encrypted_tablespaces e, 
dba_data_files d 
WHERE t.ts# = e.ts# 
and t.name = d.tablespace_name;

The next SQL statement lists the table owner, tables within encrypted tablespaces, and the encryption algorithm:

SQL&gt; SELECT a.owner "Owner", 
a.table_name "Table Name", 
e.encryptionalg "Algorithm", 
FROM dba_tables a,

Developers and implementers can increase the assurance in security functions by employing well-defined security policy models, structured, disciplined, and rigorous hardware and software development techniques, and sound system/security engineering principles.

Database Management Systems typically separate security functionality from non-security functionality via separate databases or schemas.

With the Oracle Data Masking Pack for Oracle Enterprise Manager, organizations can comply with data privacy and protection mandates that restrict the use of actual customer data.

      <title>The DBMS must check the validity of data inputs.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Invalid user input occurs when a user inserts data or characters into an application's data entry fields and the application is unprepared to process that data. This results in unanticipated application behavior, potentially leading to an application or information system compromise. Invalid user input is one of the primary methods employed when attempting to compromise an application.

All applications need to validate the data users attempt to input to the application for processing. Rules for checking the valid syntax and semantics of information system inputs (e.g., character set, length, numerical range, acceptable values) are in place to verify inputs match specified definitions for format and content. Inputs passed to interpreters are prescreened to prevent the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands.

This calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers and may have limited, if any, access to source code.

Oracle provides built-in processes to keep data and its integrity intact by using constraints.

Integrity Constraint States
You can specify that a constraint is enabled (ENABLE) or disabled (DISABLE). If a constraint is enabled, data is checked as it is entered or updated in the database, and data that does not conform to the constraint is prevented from being entered. If a constraint is disabled, then data that does not conform can be allowed to enter the database.

Additionally, you can specify that existing data in the table must conform to the constraint (VALIDATE). Conversely, if you specify NOVALIDATE, you are not ensured that existing data conforms.

An integrity constraint defined on a table can be in one of the following states:
    ENABLE, VALIDATE
    ENABLE, NOVALIDATE
    DISABLE, VALIDATE
    DISABLE, NOVALIDATE

For details about the meaning of these states and an understanding of their consequences, see the Oracle Database SQL Language Reference. Some of these consequences are discussed here.

Disabling Constraints
To enforce the rules defined by integrity constraints, the constraints should always be enabled. However, consider temporarily disabling the integrity constraints of a table for the following performance reasons:

-    When loading large amounts of data into a table

-    When performing batch operations that make massive changes to a table (for example, changing every employee's number by adding 1000 to the existing number)

-    When importing or exporting one table at a time

In all three cases, temporarily disabling integrity constraints can improve the performance of the operation, especially in data warehouse configurations.

It is possible to enter data that violates a constraint while that constraint is disabled. Thus, you should always enable the constraint after completing any of the operations listed in the preceding bullet list.

Enabling Constraints
While a constraint is enabled, no row violating the constraint can be inserted into the table. However, while the constraint is disabled, such a row can be inserted. This row is known as an exception to the constraint. If the constraint is in the enable nonvalidated state, violations resulting from data entered while the constraint was disabled remain. The rows that violate the constraint must be either updated or deleted in order for the constraint to be put in the validated state.

You can identify exceptions to a specific integrity constraint while attempting to enable the constraint. See "Reporting Constraint Exceptions". All rows violating constraints are noted in an EXCEPTIONS table, which you can examine.

Enable Nonvalidate Constraint State
When a constraint is in the enable nonvalidate state, all subsequent statements are checked for conformity to the constraint. However, any existing data in the table is not checked. A table with enable nonvalidated constraints can contain invalid data, but it is not possible to add new invalid data to it. Enabling constraints in the nonvalidated state is most useful in data warehouse configurations that are uploading valid OLTP data.

Enabling a constraint does not require validation. Enabling a constraint nonvalidate is much faster than enabling and validating a constraint. Also, validating a constraint that is already enabled does not require any DML locks during validation (unlike validating a previously disabled constraint). Enforcement guarantees that no violations are introduced during the validation. Hence, enabling without validating enables you to reduce the downtime typically associated with enabling a constraint.

Efficient Use of Integrity Constraints: A Procedure

Using integrity constraint states in the following order can ensure the best benefits:
    Disable state.
    Perform the operation (load, export, import).
    Enable nonvalidate state.
    Enable state.

Some benefits of using constraints in this order are:
    No locks are held.
    All constraints can go to enable state concurrently.
    Constraint enabling is done in parallel.
    Concurrent activity on table is permitted.

Setting Integrity Constraints Upon Definition
When an integrity constraint is defined in a CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement, it can be enabled, disabled, or validated or not validated as determined by your specification of the ENABLE/DISABLE clause. If the ENABLE/DISABLE clause is not specified in a constraint definition, the database automatically enables and validates the constraint.

Disabling Constraints Upon Definition
The following CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements both define and disable integrity constraints:

CREATE TABLE emp (
    empno NUMBER(5) PRIMARY KEY DISABLE,   . . . ;

ALTER TABLE emp
   ADD PRIMARY KEY (empno) DISABLE;

An ALTER TABLE statement that defines and disables an integrity constraint never fails because of rows in the table that violate the integrity constraint. The definition of the constraint is allowed because its rule is not enforced.
Enabling Constraints Upon Definition

The following CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements both define and enable integrity constraints:

CREATE TABLE emp (
    empno NUMBER(5) CONSTRAINT emp.pk PRIMARY KEY,   . . . ;

ALTER TABLE emp
    ADD CONSTRAINT emp.pk PRIMARY KEY (empno);

An ALTER TABLE statement that defines and attempts to enable an integrity constraint can fail because rows of the table violate the integrity constraint. If this case, the statement is rolled back, and the constraint definition is not stored and not enabled.

When you enable a UNIQUE or PRIMARY KEY constraint an associated index is created.</check-content>

      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Any application providing too much information in error logs and in administrative messages to the screen risks compromising the data and security of the application and system. The structure and content of error messages needs to be carefully considered by the organization and development team.

The extent to which the application is able to identify and handle error conditions is guided by organizational policy and operational requirements. Sensitive information includes account numbers, social security numbers, and credit card numbers.

Databases can inadvertently provide a wealth of information to an attacker through improperly handled error messages.

      <title>When using command-line tools such as Oracle SQL*Plus, which can accept a plain-text password, users must use an alternative login method that does not expose the password.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;The SRG states:  "To prevent the compromise of authentication information, such as passwords, during the authentication process, the feedback from the information system shall not provide any information that would allow an unauthorized user to compromise the authentication mechanism."

"Obfuscation of user-provided information when typed into the system is a method used in addressing this risk."

"Database applications may allow for entry of the account name and password as a visible parameter of the application execution command. This practice should be prohibited and disabled to prevent shoulder surfing."

SQL*Plus is an essential part of any Oracle installation.  SQL*Plus cannot be configured not to accept a plain-text password.  Since the typical SQL*Plus user is a database administrator, the consequences of password compromise are particularly serious.  Therefore, the use of plain-text passwords must be prohibited, as a matter of practice and procedure.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <fixtext fixref="F-21512r307214_fix">For Oracle SQL*Plus, which cannot be configured not to accept a plain-text password, and any other essential tool with the same limitation:

1) Document the need for it, who uses it, and any relevant mitigations, and obtain AO approval.
2) Train all users of the tool in the importance of not using the plain-text password option, and in how to keep the password hidden.

- - - - -

Consider wrapping the startup command with a shell or wrapper and using an Oracle external password store.

Oracle provides the capability to provide for a secure external password facility.  Use the Oracle mkstore to create a secure storage area for passwords for applications, batch jobs and scripts to use or deploy a site-authorized facility to perform this function.

Check to see what has been stored in the Oracle External Password Store.

  To view all contents of a client wallet external password store, check specific credentials by viewing them. Listing the external password store contents provides information you can use to decide whether to add or delete credentials from the store.

To list the contents of the external password store, enter the following command at the command line:

  $ mkstore -wrl wallet_location -listCredential

  For example:

  $ mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\11.2.0\db_1\wallets -listCredential

  The wallet_location specifies the path to the directory where the wallet, whose external password store contents you want to view, is located. This command lists all of the credential database service names (aliases) and the corresponding user name (schema) for that database. Passwords are not listed.

Configuring Clients to Use the External Password Store:

  If your client is already configured to use external authentication, such as Windows native authentication or Transport Layer Security (TLS), then Oracle Database uses that authentication method. The same credentials used for this type of authentication are typically also used to log in to the database.

  For clients not using such authentication methods or wanting to override them for database authentication, you can set the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter in sqlnet.ora to TRUE. The default value for SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE is FALSE, allowing standard use of authentication credentials as before.

  If you want a client to use the secure external password store feature, then perform the following configuration task:

    1. Create a wallet on the client by using the following syntax at the command line:
 
 mkstore -wrl wallet_location -create

    For example:

    mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\12.1.0\db_1\wallets -create
    Enter password: password

    The wallet_location is the path to the directory where you want to create and store the wallet. This command creates an Oracle wallet with the autologin feature enabled at the location you specify. The autologin feature enables the client to access the wallet contents without supplying a password. 
 
 The mkstore utility -create option uses password complexity verification.
 
 2. Create database connection credentials in the wallet by using the following syntax at the command line:

    mkstore -wrl wallet_location -createCredential db_connect_string username
    Enter password: password

    For example:

    mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\11.2.0\db_1\wallets -createCredential oracle system
    Enter password: password

    In this specification:

    The wallet_location is the path to the directory where you created the wallet.  The db_connect_string used in the CONNECT /@db_connect_string statement must be identical to the db_connect_string specified in the -createCredential command.
 
 The db_connect_string is the TNS alias you use to specify the database in the tnsnames.ora file or any service name you use to identify the database on an Oracle network. By default, tnsnames.ora is located in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory on UNIX systems and in ORACLE_HOME\network\admin on Windows.
 
 The username is the database logon credential. When prompted, enter the password for this user.
 
 3. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the WALLET_LOCATION parameter and set it to the directory location of the wallet you created in Step 1.  For example, if you created the wallet in 
       $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin and your Oracle home is set to /private/ora11, then you need to enter the following into your client sqlnet.ora file:
    
    WALLET_LOCATION =
           (SOURCE =
             (METHOD = FILE)
             (METHOD_DATA =
           (DIRECTORY = /private/ora11/network/admin)
           )
          )
 
 4. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter and set it to TRUE as follows:

       SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE

       This setting causes all CONNECT /@db_connect_string statements to use the information in the wallet at the specified location to authenticate to databases.

       When external authentication is in use, an authenticated user with such a wallet can use the CONNECT /@db_connect_string syntax to access the previously specified databases without providing a user name and password. However, if a user fails that external authentication, then these connect statements also fail.

    Below is a sample sqlnet.ora file with the WALLET_LOCATION and the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameters set as described in Steps 3 and 4.

        Below is a sample SQLNET.ORA File with Wallet Parameters set:

        WALLET_LOCATION =
            (SOURCE =
              (METHOD = FILE)
              (METHOD_DATA =
            (DIRECTORY = /private/ora12/network/admin)
              )
             )

        SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE
        SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = FALSE
        SSL_VERSION =1.2

(Note: This assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in the default location, is in use. Please see the supplemental file "Non-default sqlnet.ora configurations.pdf" for how to find multiple and/or differently located sqlnet.ora files.)</fixtext>

      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;It is critical when a system is at risk of failing to process audit logs as required; it detects and takes action to mitigate the failure. Audit processing failures include:  software/hardware errors, failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded. Applications are required to be capable of either directly performing or calling system-level functionality performing defined actions upon detection of an application audit log processing failure.

The Security Requirements Guide says, "A failure of database auditing will result in either the database continuing to function without auditing or in a complete halt to database operations. The database must be capable of taking organization-defined actions to avoid either a complete halt to processing or processing transactions in an unaudited manner."

This STIG requirement mandates the implementation of a method to mitigate Oracle's inability to automatically reuse audit trail space on a first-in, first-out basis.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;When dealing with change control issues, it should be noted, any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of the information system and/or application can potentially have significant effects on the overall security of the system. 

If the application were to allow any user to make changes to software libraries, then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a robust change management process.

This requirement is contingent upon the language in which the application is programmed, as many application architectures in use today incorporate their software libraries into, and make them inseparable from, their compiled distributions, rendering them static and version-dependent. However, this requirement does apply to applications with software libraries accessible and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages.

Accordingly, only qualified and authorized individuals shall be allowed to obtain access to information system components for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.

DBA and other privileged administrative or application owner accounts are granted privileges that allow actions that can have a greater impact on database security and operation.

      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;When dealing with change control issues, it should be noted, any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of the information system and/or application can potentially have significant effects on the overall security of the system. 

Multiple applications can provide a cumulative negative effect. A vulnerability and subsequent exploit to one application can lead to an exploit of other applications sharing the same security context. For example, an exploit to a web server process that leads to unauthorized administrative access to host system directories can most likely lead to a compromise of all applications hosted by the same system. Database software not installed using dedicated directories both threatens and is threatened by other hosted applications. Access controls defined for one application may by default provide access to the other application's database objects or directories. Any method that provides any level of separation of security context assists in the protection between applications.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <title>The DBMS must separate user functionality (including user interface services) from database management functionality.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Information system management functionality includes functions necessary to administer databases, network components, workstations, or servers, and typically requires privileged user access. 

The separation of user functionality from information system management functionality is either physical or logical and is accomplished by using different computers, different central processing units, different instances of the operating system, different network addresses, combinations of these methods, or other methods, as appropriate. 

An example of this type of separation is observed in web administrative interfaces that use separate authentication methods for users of any other information system resources. 

This may include isolating the administrative interface on a different domain and with additional access controls.

If administrative functionality or information regarding DBMS management is presented on an interface available for users, information on DBMS settings may be inadvertently made available to the user.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <title>The DBMS must protect against an individual using a group account from falsely denying having performed a particular action.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Non-repudiation of actions taken is required in order to maintain application integrity. Examples of particular actions taken by individuals include creating information, sending a message, approving information (e.g., indicating concurrence or signing a contract), and receiving a message. 

Non-repudiation protects individuals against later claims by an author of not having authored a particular document, a sender of not having transmitted a message, a receiver of not having received a message, or a signatory of not having signed a document. 

Group authentication does not provide individual accountability for actions taken on the DBMS or data. Whenever a single database account is used to connect to the database, a secondary authentication method that provides individual accountability is required. This scenario most frequently occurs when an externally hosted application authenticates individual users to the application and the application uses a single account to retrieve or update database information on behalf of the individual users.

When group accounts are utilized without another means of identifying individual users, users may deny having performed a particular action.


This calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the DBA must attempt to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been addressed and must document what has been discovered.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

Modify applications and data tables that are not capturing individual user identity to do so.

Create and enforce the use of individual user IDs for logging on to Oracle tools and third-party products.

If Oracle (or third-party) auditing is not already enabled, enable it.  For Oracle auditing, use this query:
ALTER SYSTEM SET AUDIT_TRAIL=&lt;audit trail type&gt; SCOPE=SPFILE;
Audit trail type can be 'OS', 'DB', 'DB,EXTENDED', 'XML' or 'XML,EXTENDED'.
After executing this statement, it may be necessary to shut down and restart the Oracle database.

For more information on the configuration of auditing, please refer to "Auditing Database Activity" in the Oracle Database 2 Day + Security Guide:
http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e10575/tdpsg_auditing.htm
and "Verifying Security Access with Auditing" in the Oracle Database Security Guide:  http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/network.112/e36292/auditing.htm#DBSEG006

http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/appdev.112/e40758/d_audit_mgmt.htm

If the site-specific audit requirements are not covered by the default audit options, deploy and configure Fine-Grained Auditing.  For details, refer to Oracle documentation, at the locations above.

If this level of auditing does not meet site-specific requirements, consider deploying the Oracle Audit Vault.  The Audit Vault is a highly configurable option from Oracle made specifically for performing the audit functions.  It has reporting capabilities as well as user-defined rules that provide additional flexibility for complex auditing requirements.</fixtext>

        <check-content>If there are no group accounts available to more than one user, this is not a finding.

If a group account is used by an application to interact with the database, review the System Security Plan, the tables in the database, and the application source code/documentation to determine whether the application captures the individual user's identity and stores that identity along with all data inserted and updated (also with all records of reads and/or deletions, if these are required to be logged).  If there are gaps in the application's ability to do this, and the gaps and the risk are not defined in the system documentation and accepted by the AO, this is a finding.

If users are sharing a group account to log on to Oracle tools or third-party products that access the database, this is a finding.

To ensure that user activities other than SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE are also monitored and attributed to individuals, verify that Oracle auditing is enabled. To see if Oracle is configured to capture audit data, enter the following SQLPlus command:
SHOW PARAMETER AUDIT_TRAIL
or the following SQL query:
SELECT * FROM SYS.V$PARAMETER WHERE NAME = 'audit_trail';
If Oracle returns the value 'NONE', this is a finding.

Review host system privileges assigned to the Oracle DBA group and all individual Oracle DBA accounts.

Note: Do not include the Oracle software installation account in any results for this check.

For UNIX systems (as root):
cat /etc/group | grep -i dba
groups root

If "root" is returned in the first list, this is a finding.

If any accounts listed in the first list are also listed in the second list, this is a finding.

Investigate any user account group memberships other than DBA or root groups that are returned by the following command (also as root):

groups [dba user account]

Replace [dba user account] with the user account name of each DBA account.

If individual DBA accounts are assigned to groups that grant access or privileges for purposes other than DBA responsibilities, this is a finding.

For Windows Systems (click or select):
Start &gt;&gt; Settings &gt;&gt; Control Panel &gt;&gt; Administrative Tools &gt;&gt; Computer Management &gt;&gt; Local Users and Groups &gt;&gt; Groups &gt;&gt; ORA_DBA
Start &gt;&gt; Settings &gt;&gt; Control Panel &gt;&gt; Administrative Tools &gt;&gt; Computer Management &gt;&gt; Local Users and Groups &gt;&gt; Groups &gt;&gt; ORA_[SID]_DBA (if present)

Note: Users assigned DBA privileges on a Windows host are granted membership in the ORA_DBA and/or ORA_[SID]_DBA groups. The ORA_DBA group grants DBA privileges to any database on the system. The ORA_[SID]_DBA groups grant DBA privileges to specific Oracle instances only.

Make a note of each user listed. For each user (click or select):
Start &gt;&gt; Settings &gt;&gt; Control Panel &gt;&gt; Administrative Tools &gt;&gt; Computer Management &gt;&gt; Local Users and Groups &gt;&gt; Users &gt;&gt; [DBA user name] &gt;&gt; Member of

If DBA users belong to any groups other than DBA groups and the Windows Users group, this is a finding.

      <title>Vendor-supported software must be evaluated and patched against newly found vulnerabilities.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Security faults with software applications and operating systems are discovered daily. Vendors are constantly updating and patching their products to address newly discovered security vulnerabilities. Organizations (including any contractor to the organization) are required to promptly install security-relevant software updates (e.g., patches, service packs, and hot fixes). Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system error handling, must also be  addressed expeditiously. 

Anytime new software code is introduced to a system there is the potential for unintended consequences. There have been documented instances where the application of a patch has caused problems with system integrity or availability.  Due to information system integrity and availability concerns, organizations must give careful consideration to the methodology used to carry out automatic updates.  

Unsupported software versions are not patched by vendors to address newly discovered security versions. An unpatched version is vulnerable to attack.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

This notice is available to anyone with a valid My Oracle Support. The security notification contains information on the current security update and also the platforms and versions that will be supported by the next patch. For complete information on the availability of the security patch for your specific system, please refer to the Oracle Lifetime Support Policy. Check My Oracle Support for the latest Oracle Quarterly Patch Update patch number, and then check the inventory of the instance you are reviewing and see if the latest security patch is installed using the following command.

      <title>DBMS default accounts must be assigned custom passwords.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Password maximum lifetime is  the maximum period of time, (typically in days) a user's password may be in effect before the user is forced to change it.

Passwords need to be changed at specific policy-based intervals as per policy. Any password, no matter how complex, can eventually be cracked.

One method of minimizing this risk is to use complex passwords and periodically change them. If the application does not limit the lifetime of passwords and force users to change their passwords, there is the risk that the system and/or application passwords could be compromised.

      <title>The DBMS must employ cryptographic mechanisms preventing the unauthorized disclosure of information during transmission unless the transmitted data is otherwise protected by alternative physical measures.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Preventing the disclosure of transmitted information requires that applications take measures to employ some form of cryptographic mechanism in order to protect the information during transmission. This is usually achieved through the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS), SSL VPN, or IPSEC tunnel.

Alternative physical protection measures include Protected Distribution Systems (PDS). PDS are used to transmit unencrypted classified NSI through an area of lesser classification or control. Inasmuch as the classified NSI is unencrypted, the PDS must provide adequate electrical, electromagnetic, and physical safeguards to deter exploitation. Refer to NSTSSI No. 7003 for additional details on a PDS.

Information in transmission is particularly vulnerable to attack. If the DBMS does not employ cryptographic mechanisms preventing unauthorized disclosure of information during transit, the information may be compromised.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <title>The DBMS must support the disabling of network protocols deemed by the organization to be non-secure.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;This requirement is related to remote access, but more specifically to the networking protocols allowing systems to communicate. Remote access is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization  controlled network (e.g., the Internet). Examples of remote access methods include dial-up, broadband, and wireless.  

Some networking protocols allowing remote access may not meet security requirements to protect data and components. Bluetooth and peer-to-peer networking are examples of less than secure networking protocols.  

The DoD Ports, Protocols, and Services Management (PPSM) program provides implementation guidance on the use of IP protocols and application and data services traversing the DoD Networks in a manner supporting net-centric operations.  

Applications implementing or utilizing remote access network protocols need to ensure the application is developed and implemented in accordance with the PPSM requirements. In situations where it has been determined that specific operational requirements outweigh the risks of enabling an insecure network protocol, the organization may pursue a risk acceptance.

Using protocols deemed non-secure would compromise the ability of the DBMS to operate in a secure fashion. The database must be able to disable network protocols deemed non-secure.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

To disable the protocol deemed not secure, stop the listener by issuing the following command as the Oracle Software owner, typically Oracle.
          $ lsnrctl stop
This will stop the listener.  Edit the LISTENER.ORA file and remove the protocols deemed not secure and restart the listener.  

For example, if TCP was deemed as not secure and the listener.ora would need to be changed and the tcp entry would need to be removed.  That would only allow the listener to listen for an IPC connection.   

LISTENER=

Review DBMS settings to determine if the database is utilizing any network protocols deemed non-secure.  If the DBMS is not using any network protocols deemed non-secure, this is not a finding..

If the database is utilizing protocols specified as non-secure in the PPSM, verify the protocols are explicitly identified in the System Security Plan and that they are in support of specific operational requirements. If they are not identified in the SSP or are not supporting specific operational requirements, this is a finding. 

If non-secure network protocols are not being used but are not disabled in the DBMS's configuration, this is a finding.

After determining the site-specific operational requirements and which protocols are explicitly defined in the System Security Plan, check the $TNS_ADMIN setting for the location of the Oracle listener.ora file.  The listener.ora file is a configuration file for Oracle Net Listener that identifies the following:
  A unique name for the listener, typically LISTENER
  A protocol address that it is accepting connection requests on, and 
  A service it is listening for.
  
If the listener.ora file shows a PROTOCOL= statement and the PROTOCOL is deemed non-secure, that is a finding.

      <title>The DBMS must provide a mechanism to automatically identify accounts designated as temporary or emergency accounts.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Temporary application accounts could be used in the event of a vendor support visit where a support representative requires a temporary unique account in order to perform diagnostic testing or conduct some other support-related activity. When these types of accounts are created, there is a risk that the temporary account may remain in place and active after the support representative has left.  

To address this, in the event temporary application accounts are required, the application must ensure accounts designated as temporary in nature shall automatically terminate these accounts after an organization-defined time period.  Such a process and capability greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be misused, hijacked, or data compromised. 

Note: User authentication and account management should be done via an enterprise-wide mechanism whenever possible.  Examples of enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Active Directory and LDAP.

      <fixtext fixref="F-41606r667481_fix">Use a profile with a distinctive name (for example, TEMPORARY_USERS), so that temporary users can be easily identified. Whenever a temporary user account is created, assign it to this profile.

Set values in the profile as needed for temporary users - see below for further information. The values here are examples; set them to values appropriate to the situation:

CREATE PROFILE TEMPORARY_USERS
LIMIT
SESSIONS_PER_USER &lt;limit&gt;
CPU_PER_SESSION &lt;limit&gt;
CPU_PER_CALL &lt;limit&gt;
CONNECT_TIME &lt;limit&gt;
LOGICAL_READS_PER_SESSION &lt;limit&gt;
LOGICAL_READS_PER_CALL &lt;limit&gt;
PRIVATE_SGA &lt;limit&gt;
COMPOSITE_LIMIT &lt;limit&gt;
FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS 3
PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME 7
PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME 60
PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX 5
PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION &lt;verify_function&gt;
PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME UNLIMITED
PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME 3;
CREATE USER TEMP001 IDENTIFIED BY PassWord#TEMP01 PROFILE TEMPORARY_USERS;

Resource Parameters:

SESSIONS_PER_USER - Specify the number of concurrent sessions to which you want to limit the user.

CPU_PER_SESSION - Specify the CPU time limit for a session, expressed in hundredths of seconds.

CPU_PER_CALL - Specify the CPU time limit for a call (a parse, execute, or fetch), expressed in hundredths of seconds.

CONNECT_TIME - Specify the total elapsed time limit for a session, expressed in minutes.

IDLE_TIME - Specify the permitted periods of continuous inactive time during a session, expressed in minutes. Long-running queries and other operations are not subject to this limit.

LOGICAL_READS_PER_SESSION - Specify the permitted number of data blocks read in a session, including blocks read from memory and disk.

LOGICAL_READS_PER_CALL - Specify the permitted number of data blocks read for a call to process a SQL statement (a parse, execute, or fetch).

PRIVATE_SGA - Specify the amount of private space a session can allocate in the shared pool of the system global area (SGA). Refer to size_clause for information on that clause.

COMPOSITE_LIMIT - See Oracle documentation for more details.

Password Parameters:

Use the following clauses to set password parameters. Parameters that set lengths of time are interpreted in number of days. For testing purposes you can specify minutes (n/1440) or even seconds (n/86400).

FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS - Specify the number of failed attempts to log in to the user account before the account is locked.

PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME - Specify the number of days the same password can be used for authentication. If you also set a value for PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME, then the password expires if it is not changed within the grace period, and further connections are rejected. If you omit this clause, then the default is 180 days.

PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME and PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX - These two parameters must be set in conjunction with each other. PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME specifies the number of days before which a password cannot be reused. PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX specifies the number of password changes required before the current password can be reused. For these parameters to have any effect, you must specify an integer for both of them.

If you specify an integer for both of these parameters, then the user cannot reuse a password until the password has been changed the number of times specified for PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX during the number of days specified for PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME.

For example, if you specify PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME to 30 and PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX to 10, then the user can reuse the password after 30 days if the password has already been changed 10 times.

If you specify an integer for either of these parameters and specify UNLIMITED for the other, then the user can never reuse a password.

If you specify DEFAULT for either parameter, then Oracle Database uses the value defined in the DEFAULT profile. By default, all parameters are set to UNLIMITED in the DEFAULT profile. If you have not changed the default setting of UNLIMITED in the DEFAULT profile, then the database treats the value for that parameter as UNLIMITED.

If you set both of these parameters to UNLIMITED, then the database ignores both of them. This is the default if you omit both parameters.

PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME - Specify the number of days an account will be locked after the specified number of consecutive failed logon attempts. If you omit this clause, then the default is 1 day.

PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME - Specify the number of days after the grace period begins during which a warning is issued and logon is allowed. If you omit this clause, then the default is 7 days.

PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION - lets a PL/SQL password complexity verification script be passed as an argument to the CREATE PROFILE statement. Oracle Database provides a default script, but you can create your own routine or use third-party software instead.

      <title>The DBMS must provide a mechanism to automatically terminate accounts designated as temporary or emergency accounts after an organization-defined time period.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Temporary application accounts could ostensibly be used in the event of a vendor support visit where a support representative requires a temporary unique account in order to perform diagnostic testing or conduct some other support related activity. When these types of accounts are created, there is a risk that the temporary account may remain in place and active after the support representative has left.  

To address this, in the event temporary application accounts are required, the application must ensure accounts designated as temporary in nature shall automatically terminate these accounts after an organization-defined time period. Such a process and capability greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be misused, hijacked, or data compromised. 

User authentication and account management should be done via an enterprise-wide mechanism whenever possible.  Examples of enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Active Directory and LDAP.  This requirement applies to cases where it is necessary to have accounts directly managed by Oracle.

Temporary database accounts must be automatically terminated after an organization-defined time period in order to mitigate the risk of the account being used beyond its original purpose or timeframe.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <title>The DBMS must enforce Discretionary Access Control (DAC) policy allowing users to specify and control sharing by named individuals, groups of individuals, or by both, limiting propagation of access rights and includes or excludes access to the granularity of a single user.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Access control policies (e.g., identity-based policies, role-based policies, attribute-based policies) and access enforcement mechanisms (e.g., access control lists, access control matrices, cryptography) are employed by organizations to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, domains). 

DAC is a type of access control methodology serving as a means of restricting access to objects and data based on the identity of subjects and/or groups to which they belong. It is discretionary in the sense that application users with the appropriate permissions to access an application resource or data have the discretion to pass that permission on to another user either directly or indirectly.

Data protection requirements may result in a DAC policy being specified as part of the application design. Discretionary access controls would be employed at the application level to restrict and control access to application objects and data thereby providing increased information security for the organization.  

When DAC controls are employed, those controls must limit sharing to named application users, groups of users, or both. The application DAC controls must also limit the propagation of access rights and have the ability to exclude access to data down to the granularity of a single user.

Databases using DAC must have the ability for the owner of an object or information to assign or revoke rights to view or modify the object or information.  If the owner of an object or information does not have rights to exclude access to an object or information at a user level, users may gain access to objects and information they are not authorized to view/modify.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <title>The DBMS must specify an account lockout duration that is greater than or equal to the organization-approved minimum.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Anytime an authentication method is exposed, to allow for the utilization of an application, there is a risk that attempts will be made to obtain unauthorized access.

To defeat these attempts, organizations define the number of times a user account may consecutively fail a logon attempt. The organization also defines the period of time in which these consecutive failed attempts may occur.

By limiting the number of failed logon attempts, the risk of unauthorized system access via user password guessing, otherwise known as brute forcing, is reduced. Limits are imposed by locking the account.

      <title>The DBMS must have the capability to limit the number of failed login attempts based upon an organization-defined number of consecutive invalid attempts occurring within an organization-defined time period.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Anytime an authentication method is exposed,  to allow for the utilization of an application, there is a risk that attempts will be made to obtain unauthorized access. 

To defeat these attempts, organizations define the number of times a user account may consecutively fail a login attempt. The organization also defines the period of time in which these consecutive failed attempts may occur. 

By limiting the number of failed login attempts, the risk of unauthorized system access via user password guessing, otherwise known as brute forcing, is reduced. Limits are imposed by locking the account. 

More recent brute force attacks make attempts over long periods of time to circumvent intrusion detection systems and system account lockouts based entirely on the number of failed logins that are typically reset after a successful login.

Note that user authentication and account management must be done via an enterprise-wide mechanism whenever possible.  Examples of enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Active Directory and LDAP  This requirement applies to cases where it is necessary to have accounts directly managed by Oracle.

Note also that a policy that places no limit on the length of the timeframe (for counting consecutive invalid attempts) does satisfy this requirement.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <title>Databases utilizing Discretionary Access Control (DAC) must enforce a policy that limits propagation of access rights.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is based on the premise that individual users are "owners" of objects and therefore have discretion over who should be authorized to access the object and in which mode (e.g., read or write). Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object or via specified ownership assignment.

DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes user-controlled file permissions. DAC models have the potential for the access controls to propagate without limit, resulting in unauthorized access to said objects.

When applications provide a discretionary access control mechanism, the application must be able to limit the propagation of those access rights.

The DBMS must ensure the recipient of permissions possesses only the access intended. The database must enforce the ability to limit rights propagation if that is the intent of the grantor. If the propagation of access rights is not limited, users with rights to objects they do not own can continue to grant rights to those objects to other users without limit.

This is default for behavior for Oracle.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;DAC is based on the notion that individual users are "owners" of objects and therefore have discretion over who should be authorized to access the object and in which mode (e.g., read or write).

DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes user-controlled file permissions.

Including or excluding access to the granularity of a single user means providing the capability to either allow or deny access to objects (e.g., files, folders) on a per single user basis.

Databases using DAC must have the ability for the owner of an object or information to assign or revoke rights to view or modify the object or information.  If the owner of an object or information does not have rights to exclude access to an object or information at a user level, users may gain access to objects and information they are not authorized to view/modify.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

Modifications to the DBMS settings, the database files, database configuration files, or the underlying database application files themselves could have catastrophic consequences to the database.  Modification to DBMS settings could include turning off access controls to the database, the halting of archiving, the halting of auditing, and any number of other malicious actions.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

The Oracle recommended process for backup and recovery is Oracle RMAN.  If Oracle RMAN is deployed, execute the following commands to ensure that the evidence of the implementation of the backup policy includes validating that the files are restorable:

Validating Database Files with BACKUP VALIDATE
 --You can use the BACKUP VALIDATE command to do the following:
    --     Check datafiles for physical and logical block corruption
    --     Confirm that all database files exist and are in the correct locations
 --When you run BACKUP VALIDATE, RMAN reads the files to be backed up in their entirety, as it would during a real backup. RMAN does not, however, actually produce any backup sets or image copies.
--You cannot use the BACKUPSET, MAXCORRUPT, or PROXY parameters with BACKUP VALIDATE. 
--To validate files with the BACKUP VALIDATE command:
     1. Start RMAN and connect to a target database and recovery catalog (if used).
     2. Run the BACKUP VALIDATE command.
        For example, you can validate that all database files and archived logs can be backed up by running a command as shown in the following example. This command checks for physical corruptions only.
        BACKUP VALIDATE
          DATABASE
          ARCHIVELOG ALL;
      To check for logical corruptions in addition to physical corruptions, run the  following variation of the preceding command:
        BACKUP VALIDATE
          CHECK LOGICAL
          DATABASE
          ARCHIVELOG ALL;
   In the preceding examples, the RMAN client displays the same output that it would if it were really backing up the files. If RMAN cannot back up one or more of the files, then it issues an error message. 
Validating Backups Before Restoring Them
   
   You can run RESTORE ... VALIDATE to test whether RMAN can restore a specific file or set of files from a backup. RMAN chooses which backups to use. The database must be mounted or open for this command. You do not have to take datafiles offline when validating the restore of datafiles, because validation of backups of the datafiles only reads the backups and does not affect the production datafiles. When validating files on disk or tape, RMAN reads all blocks in the backup piece or image copy. RMAN also validates offsite backups. The validation is identical to a real restore operation except that RMAN does not write output files.
   
   To validate backups with the RESTORE command:
     1. Run the RESTORE command with the VALIDATE option.
        This following example illustrates validating the restore of the database and all archived redo logs:
        RESTORE DATABASE VALIDATE;
          RESTORE ARCHIVELOG ALL VALIDATE;

  If you do not see an RMAN error stack, then skip the subsequent steps. The lack of error messages means that RMAN had confirmed that it can use these backups successfully during a real restore and recovery.

 2. If you see error messages in the output and the RMAN-06026 message, then investigate the cause of the problem. If possible, correct the problem that is preventing RMAN from validating the backups and retry the validation. The following error means that RMAN cannot restore one or more of the specified files from your available backups:

    RMAN-06026: some targets not found - aborting restore
       The following sample output shows that RMAN encountered a problem reading the specified backup:
       RMAN-03009: failure of restore command on c1 channel at 12-DEC-06 23:22:30
       ORA-19505: failed to identify file "oracle/dbs/1fafv9gl_1_1"

Lost or compromised DBMS backup and restoration files may lead to not only the loss of data, but also the unauthorized access to sensitive data. Backup files need the same protections against unauthorized access when stored on backup media as when online and actively in use by the database system. In addition, the backup media needs to be protected against physical loss. Most DBMS's maintain online copies of critical control files to provide transparent or easy recovery from hard disk loss or other interruptions to database operation.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <title>The DBMS must use multifactor authentication for access to user accounts.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Multifactor authentication is defined as using two or more factors to achieve authentication.

Factors include: 
(i) Something a user knows (e.g., password/PIN); 
(ii) Something a user has (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); or
(iii) Something a user is (e.g., biometric).

The DBMS must be configured to automatically utilize organization-level account management functions, and these functions must immediately enforce the organization's current account policy. 


The lack of multifactor authentication makes it much easier for an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a system.

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the successor protocol to Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Although the Oracle configuration parameters have names including 'SSL', such as SSL_VERSION and SSL_CIPHER_SUITES, they refer to TLS.
Use authentication to prove the identities of users who are attempting to log on to the database. Oracle Database enables strong authentication with Oracle authentication adapters that support various third-party authentication services, including TLS with digital certificates, as well as Smart Cards (CAC, PIV).&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <title>The DBMS must ensure users are authenticated with an individual authenticator prior to using a group authenticator.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;To assure individual accountability and prevent unauthorized access, application users (and any processes acting on behalf of users) must be individually identified and authenticated.  

A group authenticator is a generic account used by multiple individuals. Use of a group authenticator alone does not uniquely identify individual users. An example of a group authenticator is the UNIX OS 'root' user account, a Windows 'administrator' account, an 'SA' account, or a 'helpdesk' account.

For example, the UNIX and Windows operating systems offer a 'switch user' capability allowing users to authenticate with their individual credentials and, when needed, 'switch' to the administrator role. This method provides for unique individual authentication prior to using a group authenticator.

Some applications may not have the need to provide a group authenticator; this is considered a matter of application design. In those instances where the application design includes the use of a group authenticator, this requirement will apply.

There may also be instances when specific user actions need to be performed on the information system without unique user identification or authentication. An example of this type of access is a web server which contains publicly releasable information. These types of accesses are allowed but must be explicitly identified and documented by the organization.

When group accounts are utilized without another means of identifying individual users, users may deny having performed a particular action.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

Review DBMS settings to determine if individual authentication is required before group authentication. If group authentication does not require prior individual authentication, this is a finding.

(Oracle Access Manager may be helpful in meeting this requirement. Notes on Oracle Access Manager follow.)

Oracle Access Manager is used when there is a need for multifactor authentication of applications front-ending Oracle Datasets that may use group accounts. Oracle Access Manager supports using PKI-based smart cards (CAC, PIV) for multifactor authentication. When a user authenticates to a smart card application, the smart card engine produces a certificate-based authentication token. You can configure a certificate-based authentication scheme in Oracle Access Manager that uses information from the smart card certificate. Certificate-based authentication works with any smart card or similar device that presents an X.509 certificate.

Check:

First, check that the Authentication Module is set up properly:
1)  Go to Oracle Access Manager Home Screen and click the Policy Configuration tab.  Select the X509Scheme.
2)  Make sure the Authentication Module option is set to X509Plugin.

Second, check your Authentication policy is using the x509Scheme:
1)  Go to Oracle Access Manager Home Screen and click the Policy Configuration tab.
2)  Select Application Domains.  Select Search.
3)  Select the application domain protecting the Oracle Database.
4)  Select the Authentication Polices tab and Click Protected Resource Policy.
5)  Make sure the Authentication Scheme is set to x509Scheme.</check-content>

      <title>The DBMS must disable user accounts after 35 days of inactivity.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Attackers that are able to exploit an inactive DBMS account can potentially obtain and maintain undetected access to the database. 

Owners of inactive DBMS accounts will not notice if unauthorized access to their user account has been obtained. All DBMS need to track periods of user inactivity and disable accounts after 35 days of inactivity. Such a process greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be hijacked, leading to a data compromise.
 
To address access requirements, some database administrators choose to integrate their databases with enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements. Such integration allows the database administrator to off-load those access control functions and focus on core application features and functionality. 

This policy does not apply to either emergency accounts or infrequently used accounts. Infrequently used accounts are local logon administrator accounts used by system administrators when network or normal logon/access is not available. Emergency accounts are administrator accounts created in response to crisis situations.

Note that user authentication and account management must be done via an enterprise-wide mechanism whenever possible. Examples of enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Active Directory and LDAP This requirement applies to cases where it is necessary to have accounts directly managed by Oracle&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <title>The DBMS must support organizational requirements to enforce minimum password length.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. 

To meet password policy requirements, passwords need to be changed at specific policy-based intervals.  

If the information system or application allows the user to consecutively reuse their password when that password has exceeded its defined lifetime, the end result is a password that is not changed as per policy requirements. 

Weak passwords are a primary target for attack to gain unauthorized access to databases and other systems. Where username/password is used for identification and authentication to the database, requiring the use of strong passwords can help prevent simple and more sophisticated methods for guessing at passwords.

Note that user authentication and account management must be done via an enterprise-wide mechanism whenever possible.

Changing passwords frequently can thwart password-guessing attempts or re-establish protection of a compromised DBMS account.

      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Password maximum lifetime is  the maximum period of time, (typically in days) a user's password may be in effect before the user is forced to change it.

Passwords need to be changed at specific policy-based intervals as per policy. Any password, no matter how complex, can eventually be cracked.

One method of minimizing this risk is to use complex passwords and periodically change them. If the application does not limit the lifetime of passwords and force users to change their passwords, there is the risk that the system and/or application passwords could be compromised.

The storage of passwords in application source or batch job code that is compiled, encoded, or encrypted prevents compliance with password expiration and other management requirements, as well as provides another means for potential discovery.

This requirement applies equally to those accounts managed by Oracle and those managed and authenticated by the OS or an enterprise-wide mechanism.

This requirement should not be construed as prohibiting or discouraging the encryption of source code, which remains an advisable precaution.

This calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the DBA must attempt to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been addressed and must document what has been discovered.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

Oracle provides the capability to provide for a secure external password facility.  Use the Oracle mkstore to create a secure storage area for passwords for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use or deploy a site-authorized facility to perform this function.

Check to see what has been stored in the Oracle External Password Store.

To view all contents of a client wallet external password store, check specific credentials by viewing them. Listing the external password store contents provides information you can use to decide whether to add or delete credentials from the store.  To list the contents of the external password store, enter the following command at the command line:

  $ mkstore -wrl wallet_location -listCredential

  For example:

  $ mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\11.2.0\db_1\wallets -listCredential

The wallet_location specifies the path to the directory where the wallet, whose external password store contents you want to view, is located. This command lists all of the credential database service names (aliases) and the corresponding user name (schema) for that database. Passwords are not listed.

Configuring Clients to use the External Password Store:

If your client is already configured to use external authentication, such as Windows native authentication or Transport Layer Security (TLS), then Oracle Database uses that authentication method. The same credentials used for this type of authentication are typically also used to log in to the database.

For clients not using such authentication methods or wanting to override them for database authentication, you can set the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter in sqlnet.ora to TRUE. The default value for SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE is FALSE, allowing standard use of authentication credentials as before.

If you want a client to use the secure external password store feature, then perform the following configuration task:

1. Create a wallet on the client by using the following syntax at the command line:
 
    mkstore -wrl wallet_location -create

    For example:

    mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\11.2.0\db_1\wallets -create
    Enter password: password

The wallet_location is the path to the directory where you want to create and store the wallet. This command creates an Oracle wallet with the autologin feature enabled at the location you specify. The autologin feature enables the client to access the wallet contents without supplying a password. 
 
 The mkstore utility -create option uses password complexity verification.
 
2. Create database connection credentials in the wallet by using the following syntax at the command line:

    mkstore -wrl wallet_location -createCredential db_connect_string username
    Enter password: password

    For example:

    mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\11.2.0\db_1\wallets -createCredential oracle system
    Enter password: password

    In this specification:

The wallet_location is the path to the directory where you created the wallet.  The db_connect_string used in the CONNECT /@db_connect_string statement must be identical to the db_connect_string specified in the -createCredential command.
 
The db_connect_string is the TNS alias you use to specify the database in the tnsnames.ora file or any service name you use to identify the database on an Oracle network. By default, tnsnames.ora is located in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory on UNIX systems and in ORACLE_HOME\network\admin on Windows.
 
The username is the database logon credential. When prompted, enter the password for this user.
 
3. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the WALLET_LOCATION parameter and set it to the directory location of the wallet you created in Step 1.  For example, if you created the wallet in $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin and your Oracle home is set to /private/ora11, then you need to enter the following into your client sqlnet.ora file:
    
    WALLET_LOCATION =
           (SOURCE =
             (METHOD = FILE)
             (METHOD_DATA =
           (DIRECTORY = /private/ora11/network/admin)
           )
          )
 
4. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter and set it to TRUE as follows:

       SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE

This setting causes all CONNECT /@db_connect_string statements to use the information in the wallet at the specified location to authenticate to databases.

       When external authentication is in use, an authenticated user with such a wallet can use the CONNECT /@db_connect_string syntax to access the previously specified databases without providing a user name and password. However, if a user fails that external authentication, then these connect statements also fail.
 
Below is a sample sqlnet.ora file with the WALLET_LOCATION and the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameters set as described in Steps 3 and 4.

        WALLET_LOCATION =
            (SOURCE =
              (METHOD = FILE)
              (METHOD_DATA =
            (DIRECTORY = /private/ora12/network/admin)
              )
             )

        SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE
        SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = FALSE
        SSL_VERSION = 1.2

(Note: This assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in the default location, is in use. Please see the supplemental file "Non-default sqlnet.ora configurations.pdf" for how to find multiple and/or differently located sqlnet.ora files.)</fixtext>

If any of the identified compiled, encoded, or encrypted application source code or batch job code do contain passwords used for authentication to the database, this is a finding.


The check would depend on the information provided by the DBA.  In a default Oracle installation, all passwords are stored in an encrypted manner.  Ask the DBA if they have created an External Password Store for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use.

Secure External Password Store:

You can store password credentials for connecting to databases by using a client-side Oracle wallet. An Oracle wallet is a secure software container that stores authentication and signing credentials.

This wallet usage can simplify large-scale deployments that rely on password credentials for connecting to databases. When this feature is configured, application code, batch jobs, and scripts no longer need embedded user names and passwords. This reduces risk because the passwords are no longer exposed, and password management policies are more easily enforced without changing application code whenever user names or passwords change.
  
The external password store of the wallet is separate from the area where public key infrastructure (PKI) credentials are stored. Consequently, you cannot use Oracle Wallet Manager to manage credentials in the external password store of the wallet. Instead, use the command-line utility mkstore to manage these credentials.
  
How Does the External Password Store Work?

Typically, users (and as applications, batch jobs, and scripts) connect to databases by using a standard CONNECT statement that specifies a database connection string. This string can include a user name and password, and an Oracle Net service name identifying the database on an Oracle Database network. If the password is omitted, the connection prompts the user for the password.

For example, the service name could be the URL that identifies that database, or a TNS alias you entered in the tnsnames.ora file in the database. Another possibility is a host:port:sid string.
  
The following examples are standard CONNECT statements that could be used for a client that is not configured to use the external password store:

  CONNECT salesapp@sales_db.us.example.com
  Enter password: password

  CONNECT salesapp@orasales
  Enter password: password

  CONNECT salesapp@ourhost37:1527:DB17
  Enter password: password

In these examples, salesapp is the user name, with the unique connection string for the database shown as specified in three different ways. You could use its URL sales_db.us.example.com, or its TNS alias, orasales, from the tnsnames.ora file, or its host:port:sid string.

However, when clients are configured to use the secure external password store, applications can connect to a database with the following CONNECT statement syntax, without specifying database logon credentials:

  CONNECT /@db_connect_string

  CONNECT /@db_connect_string AS SYSDBA

  CONNECT /@db_connect_string AS SYSOPER
  
In this specification, db_connect_string is a valid connection string to access the intended database, such as the service name, URL, or alias as shown in the earlier examples. Each user account must have its own unique connection string; you cannot create one connection string for multiple users.

In this case, the database credentials, user name and password, are securely stored in an Oracle wallet created for this purpose. The autologin feature of this wallet is turned on, so the system does not need a password to open the wallet. From the wallet, it gets the credentials to access the database for the user they represent.</check-content>

      <title>The DBMS must enforce password maximum lifetime restrictions.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Password maximum lifetime is the maximum period of time, (typically in days) a user's password may be in effect before the user is forced to change it.

Passwords need to be changed at specific policy-based intervals as per policy. Any password, no matter how complex, can eventually be cracked.

One method of minimizing this risk is to use complex passwords and periodically change them. If the application does not limit the lifetime of passwords and force users to change their passwords, there is the risk that the system and/or application passwords could be compromised.

The PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME parameter defines the number of days a password remains valid. This can, but must not be, set to UNLIMITED. Further, the PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME parameter, if set to UNLIMITED, can nullify the PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME. PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME must be set to 0 days (or another small integer).

Note that user authentication and account management must be done via an enterprise-wide mechanism whenever possible. Examples of enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Active Directory and LDAP. With respect to Oracle, this requirement applies to cases where it is necessary to have accounts directly managed by Oracle.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Non-local maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities conducted by individuals communicating through a network, either an external network (e.g., the Internet) or an internal network.

      <title>The DBMS must automatically terminate emergency accounts after an organization-defined time period for each type of account.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Emergency application accounts are typically created due to an unforeseen operational event or could ostensibly be used in the event of a vendor support visit where a support representative requires a temporary unique account in order to perform diagnostic testing or conduct some other support-related activity. When these types of accounts are created, there is a risk that the temporary account may remain in place and active after the support representative has left.

In the event emergency application accounts are required, the application must ensure accounts that are designated as temporary in nature shall automatically terminate these accounts after an organization-defined time period.  Such a process and capability greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be misused, hijacked, or application data compromised.

Note: User authentication and account management must be done via an enterprise-wide mechanism whenever possible.  Examples of enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Active Directory and LDAP.  This requirement applies to cases where it is necessary to have accounts directly managed by Oracle.

If it is possible for any temporary emergency accounts to be created and managed by Oracle, then the DBMS or application must provide or utilize a mechanism to automatically terminate such accounts after an organization-defined time period.

Emergency database accounts must be automatically terminated after an organization-defined time period in order to mitigate the risk of the account being misused.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain types of packets to protect devices on an organization's internal network from being directly affected by DoS attacks.

Employing increased capacity and bandwidth combined with service redundancy may reduce the susceptibility to some DoS attacks.

Some of the ways databases can limit their exposure to DoS attacks are through limiting the number of connections that can be opened by a single user and database clustering.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <title>The DBMS must verify there have not been unauthorized changes to the DBMS software and information.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Organizations are required to employ integrity verification applications on information systems to look for evidence of information tampering, errors, and omissions. The organization is also required to employ good software engineering practices with regard to commercial off-the-shelf integrity mechanisms (e.g., parity checks, cyclical redundancy checks, and cryptographic hashes), and to use tools to automatically monitor the integrity of the information system and the applications it hosts.

The DBMS opens data files and reads configuration files at system startup, system shutdown, and during abort recovery efforts. If the DBMS does not verify the trustworthiness of these files, it is vulnerable to malicious alterations of its configuration or unauthorized replacement of data.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <title>The DBMS must support taking organization-defined list of least disruptive actions to terminate suspicious events.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;System availability is a key tenet of system security. Organizations need to have the flexibility to be able to define the automated actions taken in response to an identified incident. This includes being able to define a least disruptive action the application takes to terminate suspicious events. A least disruptive action may include initiating a request for human response rather than blocking traffic or disrupting system operation.

In order to preserve availability, it is important for the DBMS to terminate suspicious events with the least disruptive action possible.  If suspicious events are not terminated, an attacker may gain entry into the system; however, if the system overreacts to a suspicious event and takes an overly disruptive action, a Denial of Service (DoS) may occur.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <title>Use of the DBMS software installation account must be restricted.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;This requirement is intended to limit exposure due to operating from within a privileged account or role. The inclusion of role is intended to address those situations where an access control policy, such as Role Based Access Control (RBAC), is being implemented and where a change of role provides the same degree of assurance in the change of access authorizations for both the user and all processes acting on behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between a privileged and non-privileged account. 

To limit exposure when operating from within a privileged account or role, the application must support organizational requirements that users of information system accounts, or roles, with access to organization-defined lists of security functions or security-relevant information, use non-privileged accounts, or roles, when accessing other (non-security) system functions.

Use of privileged accounts for non-administrative purposes puts data at risk of unintended or unauthorized loss, modification, or exposure. In particular, DBA accounts if used for non-administration application development or application maintenance can lead to miss-assignment of privileges where privileges are inherited by object owners. It may also lead to loss or compromise of application data where the elevated privileges bypass controls designed in and provided by applications.

The DBMS software installation account may require privileges not required for database administration or other functions. Use of accounts configured with excess privileges may result in the loss or compromise of data or system settings due to elevated privileges that bypass controls designed to protect them.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <title>The OS must limit privileges to change the DBMS software resident within software libraries (including privileged programs).</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;When dealing with change control issues, it should be noted, any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of the information system and/or application can potentially have significant effects on the overall security of the system.

If the application were to allow any user to make changes to software libraries, then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a robust change management process.

This requirement is contingent upon the language in which the application is programmed, as many application architectures in use today incorporate their software libraries into, and make them inseparable from, their compiled distributions, rendering them static and version-dependent.  However, this requirement does apply to applications with software libraries accessible and configurable as in the case of interpreted languages.

Accordingly, only qualified and authorized individuals shall be allowed to obtain access to information system components for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.

The DBMS software libraries contain the executables used by the DBMS to operate. Unauthorized access to the libraries can result in malicious alteration. This may in turn jeopardize data stored in the DBMS and/or operation of the host system.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>
