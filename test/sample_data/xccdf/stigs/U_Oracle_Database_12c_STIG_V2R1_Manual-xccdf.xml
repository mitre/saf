DBAs are special purpose accounts and do not require disabling although they may own objects.

For application objects that require routine maintenance, e.g. index objects, to maintain performance, consider allowing a special purpose account to own the index or enable the application owner account for the duration of the routine maintenance function only.</fixtext><fix id="F-21561r533087_fix" /><check system="C-21562r533086_chk"><check-content-ref href="Oracle_Database_12c_STIG.xml" name="M" /><check-content>Run the SQL query:

(With respect to the list of special accounts that are excluded from this requirement, it is expected that the DBA will maintain the list to suit local circumstances, adding special accounts as necessary and removing any that are not supposed to be in use in the Oracle deployment that is under review.)

To obtain a list of users assigned DBA privileges, run the query:

  select grantee from dba_role_privs where granted_role = 'DBA';

If any records are returned, then verify the account is an authorized application object owner account or a default account installed to support an Oracle product.

Verify that any objects owned by custom DBA accounts are for the personal use of that DBA.

If any objects are used to support applications or any functions other than DBA functions, this is a finding.

1 = read/write
2 = read/execute
3 = read
4 = write/execute
5 = write
6 = execute
7 = no permissions

Setting the umask to 022 effectively sets files for user/owner to read/write, group to read and other to read. Directories are set for user/owner to read/write/execute, group to read/execute and other to read/execute.

For Windows Systems:
Review the permissions that control access to the Oracle installation software directories (e.g. \Program Files\Oracle\).

DBA accounts, the DBMS process account, the DBMS software installation/maintenance account, SA accounts if access by them is required for some operational level of support such as backups, and the host system itself require access.

If this rule is database-specific, then determine if the SERVICE_NAMES parameter is set:

From SQL*PLUS:

select value from v$parameter where name = 'service_names';

If SERVICE_NAMES is set in the initialization file for the database instance, use (srv=[service name]), else, use (srv=*) if not set or rule applies to all databases on the DBMS server.

If network access restriction is performed by an external device, validate ACLs are in place to prohibit unauthorized access to the DBMS.  To do this, find the IP address of the database server (destination address) and source address (authorized IPs) in the System Security Plan.

If no records are returned or if output from the SQL statement above does not show classification labels being audited as required in the System Security Plan, this is a finding.

If Unified Auditing is used:
To see if Oracle is configured to capture audit data including changes to security label assignment, enter the following SQL*Plus command:

If Oracle returns "no rows selected", this is not a finding.

To confirm that Oracle audit is capturing sufficient information to establish that changes to classification labels are being audited, perform a successful auditable action and an auditable action that results in an SQL error, and then view the results in the SYS.UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL view.

If the private key is stolen, this will lead to the compromise of the authentication and non-repudiation gained through PKI because the attacker can use the private key to digitally sign documents and can pretend to be the authorized user.

Both the holders of a digital certificate and the issuing authority must protect the computers, storage devices, or whatever they use to keep the private keys.

All access to the private key of the DBMS must be restricted to authorized and authenticated users. If unauthorized users have access to the DBMS’s private key, an attacker could gain access to the primary key and use it to impersonate the database on the network.

An Oracle Wallet is a container that is used to store authentication and signing credentials, including private keys, certificates, and trusted certificates needed by TLS. In an Oracle environment, every entity that communicates over TLS must have a wallet containing an X.509 version 3 certificate, private key, and list of trusted certificates, with the exception of Diffie-Hellman.

Roles and Profiles are two Oracle features that should be employed in account management. (Indeed, other requirements mandate the use of Roles.) Following are some notes from Oracle on the use of Profiles.

A profile is a named set of resource limits and password parameters that restrict database usage and instance resources for a user. You can assign a profile to each user, and a default profile to all others. Each user can have only one profile, and creating a new one supersedes any earlier one.

Profile resource limits are enforced only when you enable resource limitation for the associated database. Enabling such limitation can occur either before starting up the database (the RESOURCE_LIMIT initialization parameter) or while it is open (using an ALTER SYSTEM statement).

While password parameters reside in profiles, they are unaffected by RESOURCE_LIMIT or ALTER SYSTEM and password management is always enabled.</fixtext><fix id="F-21972r391927_fix" /><check system="C-21980r391926_chk"><check-content-ref href="Oracle_Database_12c_STIG.xml" name="M" /><check-content>If all user accounts are authenticated by the OS or an enterprise-level authentication/access mechanism, and not by Oracle, this is not a finding.

Unified Audit supports named audit policies, which are defined using the CREATE AUDIT POLICY statement. A policy specifies the actions that should be audited and the objects to which it should apply. If no specific objects are included in the policy definition, it applies to all objects.

A named policy is enabled using the AUDIT POLICY statement. It can be enabled for all users, for specific users only, or for all except a specified list of users. The policy can audit successful actions, unsuccessful actions, or both.

Verifying existing audit policy:  existing Unified Audit policies are listed in the view AUDIT_UNIFIED_POLICIES. The AUDIT_OPTION column contains one of the actions specified in a CREATE AUDIT POLICY statement. The AUDIT_OPTION_TYPE column contains 'STANDARD ACTION' for a policy that applies to all objects or 'OBJECT ACTION' for a policy that audits actions on a specific object.

select POLICY_NAME from SYS.AUDIT_UNIFIED_POLICIES where AUDIT_OPTION='GRANT' and AUDIT_OPTION_TYPE='STANDARD ACTION';

To find policies that audit privilege grants on specific objects:

select POLICY_NAME,OBJECT_SCHEMA,OBJECT_NAME from SYS.AUDIT_UNIFIED_POLICIES where AUDIT_OPTION='GRANT' and AUDIT_OPTION_TYPE='OBJECT ACTION';

The view AUDIT_UNIFIED_ENABLED_POLICIES shows which Unified Audit policies are enabled. The ENABLED_OPT and USER_NAME columns show the users for whom the policy is enabled or 'ALL USERS'. The SUCCESS and FAILURE columns indicate if the policy is enabled for successful or unsuccessful actions, respectively.

If Standard Auditing is used:
Revoke access to the AUD$ table to anyone who should not have access to it.

In the check we looked for all users who had access to the AUD$ table. To fix this, use the REVOKE command to revoke access to users who should not have access to the audit data.

REVOKE statement

Use the REVOKE statement to remove permissions from a specific user or from all users to perform actions on database objects.
The following types of permissions can be revoked:

    Delete data from a specific table.
    Insert data into a specific table.
    Create a foreign key reference to the named table or to a subset of columns from a table.
    Select data from a table, view, or a subset of columns in a table.
    Create a trigger on a table.
    Update data in a table or in a subset of columns in a table.
    Run a specified routine (function or procedure).

If a user named FRED had access to the AUD$ table and wanting to revoke that access, use the following command. The syntax that would be used for the REVOKE statement for tables is as follows:

REVOKE privilege-type ON [ TABLE ] { table-Name | view-Name } FROM grantees

SQL&gt;REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE AUD$ FROM FRED; 

Revoking a privilege without specifying a column list revokes the privilege for all of the columns in the table.
Syntax for routines

table-privileges include

  DELETE |
  INSERT |
  REFERENCES [column list] |
  SELECT [column list] |
  TRIGGER |
  UPDATE [column list] 

column list

  ( column-identifier {, column-identifier}* ) 

Use the ALL PRIVILEGES privilege type to revoke all of the permissions from the user for the specified table. Can also revoke one or more table privileges by specifying a privilege-list.

Use the DELETE privilege type to revoke permission to delete rows from the specified table.

Use the INSERT privilege type to revoke permission to insert rows into the specified table.

Use the REFERENCES privilege type to revoke permission to create a foreign key reference to the specified table. If a column list is specified with the REFERENCES privilege, the permission is revoked on only the foreign key reference to the specified columns.

Use the SELECT privilege type to revoke permission to perform SELECT statements on a table or view. If a column list is specified with the SELECT privilege, the permission is revoked on only those columns. If no column list is specified, then the privilege is valid on all of the columns in the table.

Use the TRIGGER privilege type to revoke permission to create a trigger on the specified table.

Use the UPDATE privilege type to revoke permission to use the UPDATE statement on the specified table. If a column list is specified, the permission is revoked only on the specified columns.
grantees

  { authorization ID | PUBLIC } [,{ authorization ID | PUBLIC } ] *

Can revoke the privileges from specific users or from all users. Use the keyword PUBLIC to specify all users. The privileges revoked from PUBLIC and from individual users are independent privileges. For example, a SELECT privilege on table t is granted to both PUBLIC and to the authorization ID harry. The SELECT privilege is later revoked from the authorization ID 'Harry', but the authorization ID 'Harry' can access the table through the PUBLIC privilege.

Restriction: Cannot revoke the privileges of the owner of an object.
routine-designator

  {
   qualified-name [ signature ]
  }

Cascading object dependencies

For views, triggers, and constraints, if the privilege on which the object depends is revoked, the object is automatically dropped. Derby does not try to determine if there are other privileges that can replace the privileges that are being revoked. For more information, see "SQL standard authorization" in the Java DB Developer's Guide.
Limitations

The following limitations apply to the REVOKE statement:

Table-level privileges:

All of the table-level privilege types for a specified grantee and table ID are stored in one row in the SYSTABLEPERMS system table. For example, when user2 is granted the SELECT and DELETE privileges on table user1.t1, a row is added to the SYSTABLEPERMS table. The GRANTEE field contains user2 and the TABLEID contains user1.t1. The SELECTPRIV and DELETEPRIV fields are set to Y. The remaining privilege type fields are set to N.

When a grantee creates an object that relies on one of the privilege types, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the object on the specific row in the SYSTABLEPERMS table. For example, user2 creates the view v1 by using the statement SELECT * FROM user1.t1; the dependency manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1). The dependency manager knows only that the view is dependent on a privilege type in that specific row but does not track exactly which privilege type the view is dependent on.

When a REVOKE statement for a table-level privilege is issued for a grantee and table ID, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee and table ID are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the DELETE privilege on table t1 from user2, the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1) is modified by the REVOKE statement. The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the DELETE privilege for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1).

Column-level privileges:

Only one type of privilege for a specified grantee and table ID are stored in one row in the SYSCOLPERMS system table. For example, when user2 is granted the SELECT privilege on table user1.t1 for columns c12 and c13, a row is added to the SYSCOLPERMS. The GRANTEE field contains user2, the TABLEID contains user1.t1, the TYPE field contains S, and the COLUMNS field contains c12, c13.

When a grantee creates an object that relies on the privilege type and the subset of columns in a table ID, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the object on the specific row in the SYSCOLPERMS table. For example, user2 creates the view v1 by using the statement SELECT c11 FROM user1.t1; the dependency manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSCOLPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S). The dependency manager knows that the view is dependent on the SELECT privilege type but does not track exactly which columns the view is dependent on.

When a REVOKE statement for a column-level privilege is issued for a grantee, table ID, and type, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee, table ID, and type are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the SELECT privilege on column c12 on table user1.t1 from user2, the row in SYSCOLPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S) is modified by the REVOKE statement. The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the column c12 for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S).

To ensure the veracity of audit data the information system and/or the application must protect audit information from unauthorized deletion. This requirement can be achieved through multiple methods which will depend upon system architecture and design.

Some commonly employed methods include:  ensuring log files enjoy the proper file system permissions utilizing file system protections; restricting access; and backing up log data to ensure log data is retained.  

Applications providing a user interface to audit data will leverage user permissions and roles identifying the user accessing the data and the corresponding rights the user enjoys in order make access decisions regarding the deletion of audit data.

Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity.

If Standard Auditing is used:
Revoke access to the AUD$ table to anyone who should not have access to it.

In the check we looked for all users who had access to the AUD$ table. To fix this, use the REVOKE command to revoke access to users who should not have access to the audit data.

REVOKE statement

Use the REVOKE statement to remove permissions from a specific user or from all users to perform actions on database objects.
The following types of permissions can be revoked:

    Delete data from a specific table.
    Insert data into a specific table.
    Create a foreign key reference to the named table or to a subset of columns from a table.
    Select data from a table, view, or a subset of columns in a table.
    Create a trigger on a table.
    Update data in a table or in a subset of columns in a table.
    Run a specified routine (function or procedure).

If a user named FRED had access to the AUD$ table and wanting to revoke that access, use the following command. The syntax that would be used for the REVOKE statement for tables is as follows:

REVOKE privilege-type ON [ TABLE ] { table-Name | view-Name } FROM grantees

SQL&gt;REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE AUD$ FROM FRED; 

Revoking a privilege without specifying a column list revokes the privilege for all of the columns in the table.
Syntax for routines

table-privileges include

  DELETE |
  INSERT |
  REFERENCES [column list] |
  SELECT [column list] |
  TRIGGER |
  UPDATE [column list] 

column list

  ( column-identifier {, column-identifier}* ) 

Use the ALL PRIVILEGES privilege type to revoke all of the permissions from the user for the specified table. Can also revoke one or more table privileges by specifying a privilege-list.

Use the DELETE privilege type to revoke permission to delete rows from the specified table.

Use the INSERT privilege type to revoke permission to insert rows into the specified table.

Use the REFERENCES privilege type to revoke permission to create a foreign key reference to the specified table. If a column list is specified with the REFERENCES privilege, the permission is revoked on only the foreign key reference to the specified columns.

Use the SELECT privilege type to revoke permission to perform SELECT statements on a table or view. If a column list is specified with the SELECT privilege, the permission is revoked on only those columns. If no column list is specified, then the privilege is valid on all of the columns in the table.

Use the TRIGGER privilege type to revoke permission to create a trigger on the specified table.

Use the UPDATE privilege type to revoke permission to use the UPDATE statement on the specified table. If a column list is specified, the permission is revoked only on the specified columns.
grantees

  { authorization ID | PUBLIC } [,{ authorization ID | PUBLIC } ] *

Can revoke the privileges from specific users or from all users. Use the keyword PUBLIC to specify all users. The privileges revoked from PUBLIC and from individual users are independent privileges. For example, a SELECT privilege on table t is granted to both PUBLIC and to the authorization ID harry. The SELECT privilege is later revoked from the authorization ID 'Harry', but the authorization ID 'Harry' can access the table through the PUBLIC privilege.

Restriction: Cannot revoke the privileges of the owner of an object.

Cascading object dependencies

For views, triggers, and constraints, if the privilege on which the object depends is revoked, the object is automatically dropped. Derby does not try to determine if there are  other privileges that can replace the privileges that are being revoked. For more information, see "SQL standard authorization" in the Java DB Developer's Guide.
Limitations

The following limitations apply to the REVOKE statement:

Table-level privileges:

All of the table-level privilege types for a specified grantee and table ID are stored in one row in the SYSTABLEPERMS system table. For example, when user2 is granted the SELECT and DELETE privileges on table user1.t1, a row is added to the SYSTABLEPERMS table. The GRANTEE field contains user2 and the TABLEID contains user1.t1. The SELECTPRIV and DELETEPRIV fields are set to Y. The remaining privilege type fields are set to N.

When a grantee creates an object that relies on one of the privilege types, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the object on the specific row in the SYSTABLEPERMS table. For example, user2 creates the view v1 by using the statement SELECT * FROM user1.t1; the dependency manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1). The dependency manager knows only that the view is dependent on a privilege type in that specific row but does not track exactly which privilege type the view is dependent on.

When a REVOKE statement for a table-level privilege is issued for a grantee and table ID, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee and table ID are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the DELETE privilege on table t1 from user2, the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1) is modified by the REVOKE statement. The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the DELETE privilege for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1).

Column-level privileges:

Only one type of privilege for a specified grantee and table ID are stored in one row in the SYSCOLPERMS system table. For example, when user2 is granted the SELECT privilege on table user1.t1 for columns c12 and c13, a row is added to the SYSCOLPERMS. The GRANTEE field contains user2, the TABLEID contains user1.t1, the TYPE field contains S, and the COLUMNS field contains c12, c13.

When a grantee creates an object that relies on the privilege type and the subset of columns in a table ID, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the object on the specific row in the SYSCOLPERMS table. For example, user2 creates the view v1 by using the statement SELECT c11 FROM user1.t1; the dependency manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSCOLPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S). The dependency manager knows that the view is dependent on the SELECT privilege type but does not track exactly which columns the view is dependent on.

When a REVOKE statement for a column-level privilege is issued for a grantee, table ID, and type, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee, table ID, and type are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the SELECT privilege on column c12 on table user1.t1 from user2, the row in SYSCOLPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S) is modified by the REVOKE statement. The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the column c12 for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S).

The following are notes on implementing a Secure External Password Store using Oracle Wallet.

Oracle provides the capability to provide for a secure external password facility.  Use the Oracle mkstore to create a secure storage area for passwords for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use, or deploy a site-authorized facility to perform this function.

Check to see what has been stored in the Oracle External Password Store

To view all contents of a client wallet external password store, check specific credentials by viewing them. Listing the external password store contents provides information that can be used to decide whether to add or delete credentials from the store.  To list the contents of the external password store, enter the following command at the command line:

$ mkstore -wrl wallet_location -listCredential

For example: $ mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\12.1.0\db_1\wallets -listCredential

The wallet_location specifies the path to the directory where the wallet, whose external password store contents is to be viewed, is located. This command lists all of the credential database service names (aliases) and the corresponding user name (schema) for that database. Passwords are not listed.

Configuring Clients to Use the External Password Store

If the client is already configured to use external authentication, such as Windows native authentication or Transport Layer Security (TLS), then Oracle Database uses that authentication method. The same credentials used for this type of authentication are typically also used to log on to the database.

For clients not using such authentication methods or wanting to override them for database authentication, can set the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter in sqlnet.ora to TRUE. The default value for SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE is FALSE, allowing standard use of authentication credentials as before.

If wanting a client to use the secure external password store feature, then perform the following configuration task:

1. Create a wallet on the client by using the following syntax at the command line:

mkstore -wrl wallet_location -create

For example: mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\12.1.0\db_1\wallets -create
Enter password: password

The wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet is to be created and stored. This command creates an Oracle wallet with the autologon feature enabled at the location specified. The autologon feature enables the client to access the wallet contents without supplying a password.

The mkstore utility -create option uses password complexity verification.

2. Create database connection credentials in the wallet by using the following syntax at the command line:

mkstore -wrl wallet_location -createCredential db_connect_string username
Enter password: password

For example: mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\12.1.0\db_1\wallets -createCredential oracle system
Enter password: password

In this specification, the wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet was created. The db_connect_string used in the CONNECT /@db_connect_string statement must be identical to the db_connect_string specified in the -createCredential command. The db_connect_string is the TNS alias used to specify the database in the tnsnames.ora file or any service name used to identify the database on an Oracle network. By default, tnsnames.ora is located in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory on UNIX systems and in ORACLE_HOME\network\admin on Windows.  The username is the database logon credential. When prompted, enter the password for this user.

3. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the WALLET_LOCATION parameter and set it to the directory location of the wallet created in Step 1.  For example, if created the wallet in $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin and Oracle home is set to /private/ora12, then need to enter the following into client sqlnet.ora file:

    WALLET_LOCATION =
           (SOURCE =
             (METHOD = FILE)
             (METHOD_DATA =
           (DIRECTORY = /private/ora12/network/admin)
           )
          )

4. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter and set it to TRUE as follows:

SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE

This setting causes all CONNECT /@db_connect_string statements to use the information in the wallet at the specified location to authenticate to databases.

When external authentication is in use, an authenticated user with such a wallet can use the CONNECT /@db_connect_string syntax to access the previously specified databases without providing a user name and password. However, if a user fails that external authentication, then these connect statements also fail.

Below is a sample sqlnet.ora file with the WALLET_LOCATION and the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameters set as described in Steps 3 and 4.

        WALLET_LOCATION =
            (SOURCE =
              (METHOD = FILE)
              (METHOD_DATA =
            (DIRECTORY = /private/ora12/network/admin)
              )
             )
        SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE
        SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = FALSE
        SSL_VERSION = 1.2

(Note: This assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in the default location, is in use. Please see the supplemental file "Non-default sqlnet.ora configurations.pdf" for how to find multiple and/or differently located sqlnet.ora files.)</fixtext><fix id="F-21997r392002_fix" /><check system="C-22005r392001_chk"><check-content-ref href="Oracle_Database_12c_STIG.xml" name="M" /><check-content>(Oracle stores and displays its passwords in encrypted form.

Ask the DBA to review the list of DBMS database objects, database configuration files, associated scripts, and applications defined within and external to the DBMS that access the database. The list should also include files, tables, or settings used to configure the operational environment for the DBMS and for interactive DBMS user accounts.

Ask the DBA and/or ISSO to determine if any DBMS database objects, database configuration files, associated scripts, and applications defined within or external to the DBMS that access the database, and DBMS/user environment files/settings/tables, contain database passwords. If any do, confirm that DBMS passwords stored internally or externally to the DBMS are encoded or encrypted.

Ask the DBA/SA/Application Support staff if they have created an external password store for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use.  Verify that all passwords stored there are encrypted.

The following are notes on implementing a Secure External Password Store using Oracle Wallet.

You can store password credentials for connecting to databases by using a client-side Oracle wallet. An Oracle wallet is a secure software container that stores authentication and signing credentials.

This wallet usage can simplify large-scale deployments that rely on password credentials for connecting to databases. When this feature is configured, application code, batch jobs, and scripts no longer need embedded user names and passwords. This reduces risk because the passwords are no longer exposed, and password management policies are more easily enforced without changing application code whenever user names or passwords change.

The external password store of the wallet is separate from the area where public key infrastructure (PKI) credentials are stored. Consequently, you cannot use Oracle Wallet Manager to manage credentials in the external password store of the wallet. Instead, use the command-line utility mkstore to manage these credentials.

How Does the External Password Store Work?

Typically, users (and applications, batch jobs, and scripts) connect to databases by using a standard CONNECT statement that specifies a database connection string. This string can include a user name and password, and an Oracle Net service name identifying the database on an Oracle Database network. If the password is omitted, the connection prompts the user for the password.

For example, the service name could be the URL that identifies that database, or a TNS alias entered in the tnsnames.ora file in the database. Another possibility is a host:port:sid string.

The following examples are standard CONNECT statements that could be used for a client that is not configured to use the external password store:

  CONNECT salesapp@sales_db.us.example.com
  Enter password: password

  CONNECT salesapp@orasales
  Enter password: password

  CONNECT salesapp@ourhost37:1527:DB17
  Enter password: password

In these examples, salesapp is the user name, with the unique connection string for the database shown as specified in three different ways. Could use its URL sales_db.us.example.com, or its TNS alias, orasales, from the tnsnames.ora file, or its host:port:sid string.

However, when clients are configured to use the secure external password store, applications can connect to a database with the following CONNECT statement syntax, without specifying database logon credentials:

  CONNECT /@db_connect_string

  CONNECT /@db_connect_string AS SYSDBA

  CONNECT /@db_connect_string AS SYSOPER

In this specification, db_connect_string is a valid connection string to access the intended database, such as the service name, URL, or alias as shown in the earlier examples. Each user account must have its own unique connection string; cannot create one connection string for multiple users.

In this case, the database credentials, user name and password, are securely stored in an Oracle wallet created for this purpose. The autologon feature of this wallet is turned on, so the system does not need a password to open the wallet. From the wallet, it gets the credentials to access the database for the user they represent.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-220291"><title>SRG-APP-000175-DB-000067</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-220291r397594_rule" weight="10.0" severity="medium"><version>O121-C2-015300</version><title>The DBMS, when utilizing PKI-based authentication, must validate certificates by constructing a certification path with status information to an accepted trust anchor.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public key and associated data. It is used in the context of public key infrastructures, X.509 digital certificates, and DNSSEC.

When there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor; it can be for example a Certification Authority (CA). A certification path starts with the Subject certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted root certificate, typically issued by a trusted CA.

Path validation is necessary for a relying party to make an informed trust decision when presented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted.

Status information for certification paths includes certificate revocation lists or online certificate status protocol responses.

Database Management Systems that do not validate certificates to a trust anchor are in danger of accepting certificates that are invalid and/or counterfeit. This could allow unauthorized access to the database.

The database supports PKI-based authentication by using digital certificates over TLS in addition to the native encryption and data integrity capabilities of these protocols.

The strength requirements are dependent upon data classification.

For unclassified data, where cryptography is required:
AES 128 for encryption
SHA 256 for hashing

NSA has established the suite B encryption requirements for protecting National Security Systems (NSS) as follows.
AES 128 for Secret
AES 256 for Top Secret
SHA 256 for Secret
SHA 384 for Top Secret

National Security System is defined as:
(OMB Circular A-130) Any telecommunications or information system operated by the United States Government, the function, operation, or use of which (1) involves intelligence activities; (2) involves cryptologic activities related to national security; (3) involves command and control of military forces; (4) involves equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapons system; or (5) is critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions, but excluding any system that is to be used for routine administrative and business applications (including payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management applications).

There is more information on this topic in the Oracle Database 12c Advanced Security Administrator's Guide, which may be found at https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/DBSEG/E48135-11.pdf. (Note, however, that because of changes in Oracle's licensing policy, it is no longer necessary to purchase Oracle Advanced Security to use network encryption and advanced authentication.)

Session IDs are tokens generated by web applications to uniquely identify an application user's session.   Applications will make application decisions and execute business logic based on the session ID. Unique session identifiers or IDs are the opposite of sequentially generated session IDs, which can be easily guessed by an attacker. Unique session IDs help to reduce predictability of said identifiers. Unique session IDs address man-in-the-middle attacks, including session hijacking or insertion of false information into a session. If the attackers are unable to identify or guess the session information related to pending application traffic, they will have more difficulty in hijacking the session or otherwise manipulating valid sessions. When a user logs out, or when any other session termination event occurs, the application must terminate the user session to minimize the potential for an attacker to hijack that particular user session.

Configure DBMS settings to terminate sessions upon the occurrence of any organization or policy-defined session termination event.

- - - - -

To configure specific session termination processes, we need to define the organization or policy-defined session termination event. Below are some examples.

Oracle has several ways to disconnect idle sessions, both from within SQL*Plus via resources profiles (connect_time, idle_time) and with the SQL*net expire time parameter.

Can use profiles to set the connect time and idle time with "alter profile" statements:

alter profile senior_claim_analyst limit
connect_time 15
sessions_per_user 2
ldle_time 10;

Profiles comprise a named set of resource limits. By default, when users are created, they are given the default profile, which provides unlimited use of all resources.

The syntax to create a profile follows:

CREATE PROFILE LIMIT resource_parameters|password_parameters;
Resource_parameters:
[SESSIONS_PER_USER n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]
[CPU_PER_SESSION n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]
[CPU_PER_CALL n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]
[CONNECT_TIME n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]
[IDLE_TIME n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]

By setting resource limits, can prevent users from performing operations that will tie up the system and prevent other users from performing operations. Can use resource limits for security, to ensure that users log off the system, so as not to leave the session connected for long periods of time.

The system resource limits can be enforced at the session level, the call level, or both. The session level is calculated from the time the user logs on to the database until the user exits. The call level applies to each SQL command issued. Session-level limits are enforced for each connection. When a session-level limit is exceeded, only the last SQL command issued is rolled back; no further work can be performed until a commit, rollback, or exit is performed.

Using SQLNET.EXPIRE_TIME

The sqlnet.expire_time parameter is used to set a time interval, in minutes, to determine how often a probe should be sent verifying that client/server connections are active. If there is a need to ensure that connections are not left open indefinitely (or up to the time set by operating system-specific parameters), set a value that is greater than 0. This protects the system from connections left open due to an abnormal client termination.

When the probe detects a terminated connection or a connection no longer in use, it signals an error, causing the server process to exit. This setting is intended for use on the database server side of the connection, which usually handles multiple connections at any one time. Limitations on using this terminated (dead) connection detection feature are:

sqlnet.expire_time cannot be used on bequeathed connections.

The SQL*Net expire_time probe packet will generate additional network traffic that may downgrade the network's performance, depending on the number of connections.

Depending on the operating system that is in use, additional server processing may need to be performed to distinguish the connection probe from other events that occur. This overhead for detection of probe events can result in downgraded network performance.

Turning-on expire_time

To set up these advanced features, simply edit the sqlnet.ora file. If a beginner, follow this procedure:

Start the Oracle Network Manager GUI.

In the GUI navigator pane, expand the icons Local &gt;&gt; Profile.

From the list on the right-hand pane, select General.

Click on the Advanced tab.

Next, enter the values for the fields or options to set.

When finished, choose File &gt;&gt; Save Network Configuration to write the changes to the sqlnet.ora file. (Note: This assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in the default location, is in use. Please see the supplemental file "Non-default sqlnet.ora configurations.pdf" for how to find multiple and/or differently located sqlnet.ora files.)

The sqlnet.ora inbound_connect_timeout parameter

The sqlnet.ora inbound_connect_timeout parameter is used to limit the time, set in seconds, for a client to connect with the database server and provide the required authentication information.

Also see sqlnet.inbound_connect_timeout tips.

To limit consumption of Oracle resources by unauthorized users and enable an audit trail, should set time-limit values for the sqlnet.inbound_connect_timeout parameter in wall-clock seconds. (This parameter does not have default values.) Failure resulting from sqlnet.inbound_connect_timeout will throw an ORA-03136 inbound connection timed out error.   </fixtext><fix id="F-22002r392017_fix" /><check system="C-22010r392016_chk"><check-content-ref href="Oracle_Database_12c_STIG.xml" name="M" /><check-content>Review DBMS settings and vendor documentation to verify user sessions are terminated upon user logout.

Review system documentation and organization policy to identify other events that should result in session terminations. If other session termination events are defined, review DBMS settings to verify occurrences of these events would cause session termination.

If occurrences of defined session-terminating events do not cause session terminations, this is a finding.

When a user logs off of an Oracle session gracefully or has the session terminated for an idle timeout or any other reason, the session is terminated, and the resources are returned to the system.  Check with the DBA to see what mechanism is used to disconnect the session and what events the site uses to determine if a connection needs to be terminated.

To test for timeout, open a connection and leave it idle for a period greater than the defined idle timeout setting enforced by the system.  Then try to use the connection.  If the connection is no longer active, then the mechanism deployed to terminate the connection is active and working.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-220296"><title>SRG-APP-000226-DB-000147</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-220296r397741_rule" weight="10.0" severity="medium"><version>O121-C2-018200</version><title>The DBMS must preserve any organization-defined system state information in the event of a system failure.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Failure in a known state can address safety or security in accordance with the mission/business needs of the organization.

Oracle recommends using Transparent Data Encryption to protect data.

In order to check to see if the data is encrypted, for example, upon an auditor's request, Oracle provides views that document the encryption status of the database. For TDE column encryption, use the view 'dba_encrypted_columns', which lists the owner, table name, column name, encryption algorithm, and salt for all encrypted columns. For TDE tablespace encryption, the following SQL statement lists all encrypted tablespaces with their encryption algorithm and corresponding, encrypted, data files. Issue the following commands to check to see if the data at rest is encrypted.

$ sqlplus connect as sysdba

All applications need to validate the data users attempt to input to the application for processing.

This calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers.

Oracle provides built-in processes to keep data and its integrity intact by using constraints.

Integrity Constraint States
Can specify that a constraint is enabled (ENABLE) or disabled (DISABLE). If a constraint is enabled, data is checked as it is entered or updated in the database, and data that does not conform to the constraint is prevented from being entered. If a constraint is disabled, then data that does not conform can be allowed to enter the database.

Additionally, can specify that existing data in the table must conform to the constraint (VALIDATE). Conversely, if specified NOVALIDATE, are not ensured that existing data conforms.

An integrity constraint defined on a table can be in one of the following states:
    ENABLE, VALIDATE
    ENABLE, NOVALIDATE
    DISABLE, VALIDATE
    DISABLE, NOVALIDATE

For details about the meaning of these states and an understanding of their consequences, see the Oracle Database SQL Language Reference. Some of these consequences are discussed here.

Disabling Constraints
To enforce the rules defined by integrity constraints, the constraints should always be enabled. However, consider temporarily disabling the integrity constraints of a table for the following performance reasons:

- When loading large amounts of data into a table

- When performing batch operations that make massive changes to a table (for example, changing every employee's number by adding 1000 to the existing number)

- When importing or exporting one table at a time

In all three cases, temporarily disabling integrity constraints can improve the performance of the operation, especially in data warehouse configurations.

It is possible to enter data that violates a constraint while that constraint is disabled. Thus, always enable the constraint after completing any of the operations listed in the preceding bullet list.

Enabling Constraints
While a constraint is enabled, no row violating the constraint can be inserted into the table. However, while the constraint is disabled, such a row can be inserted. This row is known as an exception to the constraint. If the constraint is in the ENABLE, NOVALIDATE state, violations resulting from data entered while the constraint was disabled remain. The rows that violate the constraint must be either updated or deleted in order for the constraint to be put in the validated state.

Can identify exceptions to a specific integrity constraint while attempting to enable the constraint. See "Reporting Constraint Exceptions". All rows violating constraints are noted in an EXCEPTIONS table, which can be examined.

ENABLE, NOVALIDATE Constraint State
When a constraint is in the ENABLE, NOVALIDATE state, all subsequent statements are checked for conformity to the constraint. However, any existing data in the table is not checked. A table with ENABLE, NOVALIDATE constraints can contain invalid data, but it is not possible to add new invalid data to it. Constraints in the ENABLE, NOVALIDATE state is most useful in data warehouse configurations that are uploading valid OLTP data.

Enabling a constraint does not require validation. Enabling a constraint novalidate is much faster than enabling and validating a constraint. Also, validating a constraint that is already enabled does not require any DML locks during validation (unlike validating a previously disabled constraint). Enforcement guarantees that no violations are introduced during the validation. Hence, enabling without validating reduces the downtime typically associated with enabling a constraint.

Efficient Use of Integrity Constraints: A Procedure

Using integrity constraint states in the following order can ensure the best benefits:
    Disable state.
    Perform the operation (load, export, import).
    ENABLE, NOVALIDATE state.
    Enable state.

Some benefits of using constraints in this order are:
    No locks are held.
    All constraints can go to enable state concurrently.
    Constraint enabling is done in parallel.
    Concurrent activity on table is permitted.

Setting Integrity Constraints Upon Definition
When an integrity constraint is defined in a CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement, it can be enabled, disabled, or validated or not validated as determined by the specification of the ENABLE/DISABLE clause. If the ENABLE/DISABLE clause is not specified in a constraint definition, the database automatically enables and validates the constraint.

Disabling Constraints Upon Definition
The following CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements both define and disable integrity constraints:

CREATE TABLE emp (
   empno NUMBER(5) PRIMARY KEY DISABLE,   . . . ;

ALTER TABLE emp
   ADD PRIMARY KEY (empno) DISABLE;

An ALTER TABLE statement that defines and disables an integrity constraint never fails because of rows in the table that violate the integrity constraint. The definition of the constraint is allowed because its rule is not enforced.

Enabling Constraints Upon Definition

The following CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements both define and enable integrity constraints:

CREATE TABLE emp (
    empno NUMBER(5) CONSTRAINT emp.pk PRIMARY KEY,   . . . ;

ALTER TABLE emp
    ADD CONSTRAINT emp.pk PRIMARY KEY (empno);

An ALTER TABLE statement that defines and attempts to enable an integrity constraint can fail because rows of the table violate the integrity constraint. If this case, the statement is rolled back, and the constraint definition is not stored and not enabled.

When enabling a UNIQUE or PRIMARY KEY constraint, an associated index is created.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-220301"><title>SRG-APP-000266-DB-000162</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-220301r397843_rule" weight="10.0" severity="medium"><version>O121-C2-019900</version><title>The DBMS must only generate error messages that provide information necessary for corrective actions without revealing organization-defined sensitive or potentially harmful information in error logs and administrative messages that could be exploited.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Any application providing too much information in error logs and in administrative messages to the screen risks compromising the data and security of the application and system.

Notes on Oracle's approach to this issue:  Out of the box, Oracle covers this. For example, if a user does not have access to a table, the error is just that the table or view does not exist. The Oracle database is not going to display a Social Security Number in an error code unless an application is programmed to do so.  Oracle applications will not expose the actual transactional data to a screen.  The only way Oracle will capture this information is to enable specific logging levels.

Consider wrapping the startup command with a shell or wrapper and using an Oracle external password store.

Oracle provides the capability to provide for a secure external password facility.  Use the Oracle mkstore to create a secure storage area for passwords for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use or deploy a site-authorized facility to perform this function.

Check to see what has been stored in the Oracle External Password Store.

To view all contents of a client wallet external password store, check specific credentials by viewing them. Listing the external password store contents provides information used to decide whether to add or delete credentials from the store.  To list the contents of the external password store, enter the following command at the command line:

  $ mkstore -wrl wallet_location -listCredential

  For example:

  $ mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\12.1.0\db_1\wallets -listCredential

The wallet_location specifies the path to the directory where the wallet, whose external password store contents is to be viewed, is located. This command lists all of the credential database service names (aliases) and the corresponding user name (schema) for that database. Passwords are not listed.

Configuring Clients to Use the External Password Store

If the client is already configured to use external authentication, such as Windows native authentication or Transport Layer Security (TLS), then Oracle Database uses that authentication method. The same credentials used for this type of authentication are typically also used to log on to the database.

For clients not using such authentication methods or wanting to override them for database authentication, set the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter in sqlnet.ora to TRUE. The default value for SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE is FALSE, allowing standard use of authentication credentials as before.

If wanting a client to use the secure external password store feature, then perform the following configuration task:

1. Create a wallet on the client by using the following syntax at the command line:
orapki create -wallet wallet_location  -auto_login_local

For example:
orapki wallet create -wallet c:\oracle\product\12.1.0\db_1\wallets -auto_login_local
Enter password: password

The wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet is to be created and stored. This command creates an Oracle wallet with the autologon feature enabled at the location specified. The autologon feature enables the client to access the wallet contents without supplying a password.

The mkstore utility -create option uses password complexity verification.

2. Create database connection credentials in the wallet by using the following syntax at the command line:
mkstore -wrl wallet_location -createCredential db_connect_string username
Enter password: password

For example:
mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\12.1.0\db_1\wallets -createCredential oracle system
Enter password: password

In this specification:
The wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet was created.  The db_connect_string used in the CONNECT /@db_connect_string statement must be identical to the db_connect_string specified in the -createCredential command.

The db_connect_string is the TNS alias used to specify the database in the tnsnames.ora file or any service name used to identify the database on an Oracle network. By default, tnsnames.ora is located in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory on UNIX systems and in ORACLE_HOME\network\admin on Windows.

The username is the database logon credential. When prompted, enter the password for this user.

3. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the WALLET_LOCATION parameter and set it to the directory location of the wallet created in Step 1.  For example, if the wallet was created in $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin and the Oracle home is set to /private/ora12, then need to enter the following into the client sqlnet.ora file:

    WALLET_LOCATION =
           (SOURCE =
             (METHOD = FILE)
             (METHOD_DATA =
           (DIRECTORY = /private/ora12/network/admin)
           )
          )

4. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter and set it to TRUE as follows:

       SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE

This setting causes all CONNECT /@db_connect_string statements to use the information in the wallet at the specified location to authenticate to databases.

When external authentication is in use, an authenticated user with such a wallet can use the CONNECT /@db_connect_string syntax to access the previously specified databases without providing a user name and password. However, if a user fails that external authentication, then these connect statements also fail.

Below is a sample sqlnet.ora file with the WALLET_LOCATION and the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameters set as described in Steps 3 and 4.

Below is a sample SQLNET.ORA File with Wallet Parameters Set

        WALLET_LOCATION =
            (SOURCE =
              (METHOD = FILE)
              (METHOD_DATA =
            (DIRECTORY = /private/ora12/network/admin)
              )
             )

        SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE
        SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = FALSE
        SSL_VERSION =1.2

(Note: This assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in the default location, is in use. Please see the supplemental file "Non-default sqlnet.ora configurations.pdf" for how to find multiple and/or differently located sqlnet.ora files.)</fixtext><fix id="F-22011r392044_fix" /><check system="C-22019r392043_chk"><check-content-ref href="Oracle_Database_12c_STIG.xml" name="M" /><check-content>For Oracle SQL*Plus, which cannot be configured not to accept a plain-text password, and any other essential tool with the same limitation, verify that the system documentation explains the need for the tool, who uses it, and any relevant mitigations; and that AO approval has been obtained.

In determining the capacity requirements, consider such factors as: total number of users; expected number of concurrent users during busy periods; number and type of events being monitored; types and amounts of data being captured; the frequency/speed with which audit records are off-loaded to the central log management system; and any limitations that exist on the DBMS's ability to reuse the space formerly occupied by off-loaded records.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Oracle Database 12c</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Oracle Database 12c</dc:subject><dc:identifier>4059</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">SV-76343</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">V-61853</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-000366</ident><fixtext fixref="F-22012r533179_fix">Allocate sufficient audit file/table space to support peak demand.

If file-based auditing is in use, check that sufficient space is available to support the file(s). If not, this is a finding.

If standard, table-based auditing is used, the audit logs are written to a table called AUD$; and if a Virtual Private Database is deployed, a table is created called FGA_LOG$. First, check the current location of the audit trail tables.

FGA_LOG$ SYSTEM

If the tablespace name is SYSTEM, the table needs to be relocated to its own tablespace. Ensure that adequate space is allocated to that tablespace.

If Unified Auditing is used:
Audit logs are written to tables in the AUDSYS schema. The default tablespace for AUDSYS is USERS. A separate tablespace should be created to contain audit data. Ensure that adequate space is allocated to that tablespace.
Investigate whether there have been any incidents where the DBMS ran out of audit log space since the last time the space was allocated or other corrective measures were taken.

If the application were to allow any user to make changes to software libraries, then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a robust change management process.

This requirement is contingent upon the language in which the application is programmed, as many application architectures in use today incorporate their software libraries into, and make them inseparable from, their compiled distributions, rendering them static and version-dependent. However, this requirement does apply to applications with software libraries accessible and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages.

Accordingly, only qualified and authorized individuals shall be allowed to obtain access to information system components for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.

DBA and other privileged administrative or application owner accounts are granted privileges that allow actions that can have a greater impact on database security and operation. It is especially important to grant access to privileged accounts to only those persons who are qualified and authorized to use them.

This requirement is particularly important because Oracle equates the installation account with the SYS account - the super-DBA.  Once logged on to the operating system, this account can connect to the database AS SYSDBA without further authentication.

Multiple applications can provide a cumulative negative effect. A vulnerability and subsequent exploit to one application can lead to an exploit of other applications sharing the same security context. For example, an exploit to a web server process that leads to unauthorized administrative access to host system directories can most likely lead to a compromise of all applications hosted by the same system. Database software not installed using dedicated directories both threatens and is threatened by other hosted applications. Access controls defined for one application may by default provide access to the other application's database objects or directories.

Examples of particular actions taken by individuals include creating information, sending a message, approving information (e.g., indicating concurrence or signing a contract), and receiving a message.

Non-repudiation protects individuals against later claims by an author of not having authored a particular document, a sender of not having transmitted a message, a receiver of not having received a message, or a signatory of not having signed a document. 

Authentication via shared accounts does not provide individual accountability for actions taken on the DBMS or data. Whenever a single database account is used to connect to the database, a secondary authentication method that provides individual accountability is required. This scenario most frequently occurs when an externally hosted application authenticates individual users to the application and the application uses a single account to retrieve or update database information on behalf of the individual users.

When shared accounts are utilized without another means of identifying individual users, users may deny having performed a particular action.

This calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored.

If a shared account is used by an application to interact with the database, review the System Security Plan, the tables in the database, and the application source code/documentation to determine whether the application captures the individual user's identity and stores that identity along with all data inserted and updated (also with all records of reads and/or deletions, if these are required to be logged).

If there are gaps in the application's ability to do this, and the gaps and the risk are not defined in the system documentation and accepted by the AO, this is a finding.

If users are sharing a group account to log on to Oracle tools or third-party products that access the database, this is a finding.

This is usually achieved through the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS), SSL VPN, or IPSEC tunnel.

Alternative physical protection measures include Protected Distribution Systems (PDS). PDS are used to transmit unencrypted classified NSI through an area of lesser classification or control. Inasmuch as the classified NSI is unencrypted, the PDS must provide adequate electrical, electromagnetic, and physical safeguards to deter exploitation. Refer to NSTSSI No. 7003 for additional details on a PDS.

Information in transmission is particularly vulnerable to attack. If the DBMS does not employ cryptographic mechanisms preventing unauthorized disclosure of information during transit, the information may be compromised.

Remote access is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization  controlled network (e.g., the Internet). Examples of remote access methods include dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

Some networking protocols allowing remote access may not meet security requirements to protect data and components. Bluetooth and peer-to-peer networking are examples of less than secure networking protocols.

The DoD Ports, Protocols, and Services Management (PPSM) program provides implementation guidance on the use of IP protocols and application and data services traversing the DoD Networks in a manner supporting net-centric operations.

Applications implementing or utilizing remote access network protocols need to ensure the application is developed and implemented in accordance with the PPSM requirements. In situations where it has been determined that specific operational requirements outweigh the risks of enabling an insecure network protocol, the organization may pursue a risk acceptance.

Using protocols deemed nonsecure would compromise the ability of the DBMS to operate in a secure fashion. The database must be able to disable network protocols deemed nonsecure.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Oracle Database 12c</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Oracle Database 12c</dc:subject><dc:identifier>4059</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">V-61555</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">SV-76045</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-000382</ident><fixtext fixref="F-40882r667131_fix">Disable any network protocol listed as nonsecure in the PPSM documentation.

To disable the protocol deemed not secure, stop the listener by issuing the following command as the Oracle Software owner, typically Oracle.
          $ lsnrctl stop
This will stop the listener.  Edit the LISTENER.ORA file and remove the protocols deemed not secure and restart the listener.

For example, if TCP was deemed as not secure, the listener.ora would need to be changed and the tcp entry would need to be removed.  That would only allow the listener to listen for an IPC connection.

Review DBMS settings to determine if the database is utilizing any network protocols deemed nonsecure.  If the DBMS is not using any network protocols deemed nonsecure, this is not a finding.

If the database is utilizing protocols specified as nonsecure in the PPSM, verify the protocols are explicitly identified in the System Security Plan and that they are in support of specific operational requirements. If they are not identified in the SSP or are not supporting specific operational requirements, this is a finding.

If nonsecure network protocols are not being used but are not disabled in the DBMS's configuration, this is a finding.

After determining the site-specific operational requirements and which protocols are explicitly defined in the System Security Plan, check the $TNS_ADMIN setting for the location of the Oracle listener.ora file.  The listener.ora file is a configuration file for Oracle Net Listener that identifies the following:

A unique name for the listener, typically LISTENER
A protocol address that it is accepting connection requests on, and
A service it is listening for.

If the listener.ora file shows a PROTOCOL= statement and the PROTOCOL is deemed nonsecure, that is a finding.

When these types of accounts are created, there is a risk that the temporary account may remain in place and active after the support representative has left.

To address this, in the event temporary application accounts are required, the application must ensure accounts designated as temporary in nature shall automatically terminate these accounts after an organization-defined time period.  Such a process and capability greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be misused, hijacked, or data compromised.

Note that user authentication and account management should be done via an enterprise-wide mechanism whenever possible.  Examples of enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Active Directory and LDAP.

Resource Parameters:

COMPOSITE_LIMIT - Specify the total resource cost for a session, expressed in service units. Oracle Database calculates the total service units as a weighted sum of CPU_PER_SESSION, CONNECT_TIME,
LOGICAL_READS_PER_SESSION, and PRIVATE_SGA.

SESSIONS_PER_USER - Specify the number of concurrent sessions to limit the user to.

CPU_PER_SESSION - Specify the CPU time limit for a session, expressed in hundredths of seconds.

CPU_PER_CALL - Specify the CPU time limit for a call (a parse, execute, or fetch), expressed in hundredths of seconds.

LOGICAL_READS_PER_SESSION - Specify the permitted number of data blocks read in a session, including blocks read from memory and disk.

LOGICAL_READS_PER_CALL - Specify the permitted number of data blocks read for a call to process a SQL statement (a parse, execute, or fetch).

PRIVATE_SGA - Specify the amount of private space a session can allocate in the shared pool of the system global area (SGA). Refer to size_clause for information on that clause.

CONNECT_TIME - Specify the total elapsed time limit for a session, expressed in minutes.

IDLE_TIME - Specify the permitted periods of continuous inactive time during a session, expressed in minutes. Long-running queries and other operations are not subject to this limit.

COMPOSITE_LIMIT - See Oracle documentation for more details.


Password Parameters

Use the following clauses to set password parameters. Parameters that set lengths of time are interpreted in number of days. For testing purposes, specify minutes (n/1440) or even seconds (n/86400).

FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS - Specify the number of failed attempts to log on to the user account before the account is locked. If omitting this clause, then the default is 10 times.

PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME - Specify the number of days the same password can be used for authentication. If setting a value for PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME, then the password expires if it is not changed within the grace period, and further connections are rejected. If omitting this clause, then the default is 180 days.

PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME and PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX - These two parameters must be set in conjunction with each other. PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME specifies the number of days before which a password cannot be reused. PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX specifies the number of password changes required before the current password can be reused. For these parameters to have any effect, specify an integer for both of them.

If specifying a value for both of these parameters, then the user cannot reuse a password until the password has been changed the number of times specified for PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX during the number of days specified for PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME.

For example, if specifying PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME to 30 and PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX to 10, then the user can reuse the password after 30 days if the password has already been changed 10 times.

If specifying a value for either of these parameters and specify UNLIMITED for the other, then the user can never reuse a password.

If specifying DEFAULT for either parameter, then Oracle Database uses the value defined in the DEFAULT profile. By default, all parameters are set to UNLIMITED in the DEFAULT profile. If the default setting of UNLIMITED in the DEFAULT profile has not changed, then the database treats the value for that parameter as UNLIMITED.

If setting both of these parameters to UNLIMITED, then the database ignores both of them. This is the default if omitting both parameters.

PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME - Specify the number of days an account will be locked after the specified number of consecutive failed logon attempts. If omitting this clause, then the default is 1 day.

PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME - Specify the number of days after the grace period begins during which a warning is issued and logon is allowed. If omitting this clause, then the default is 7 days.

PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION - The PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION clause lets a PL/SQL password complexity verification script be passed as an argument to the CREATE PROFILE statement. Oracle Database provides a default script, but can create your own routine or use third-party software instead.</fixtext><fix id="F-40883r667134_fix" /><check system="C-40920r667133_chk"><check-content-ref href="Oracle_Database_12c_STIG.xml" name="M" /><check-content>: If the organization has a policy, consistently enforced, forbidding the creation of emergency or temporary accounts, this is not a finding.

When these types of accounts are created, there is a risk that the temporary account may remain in place and active after the support representative has left.

To address this, in the event temporary application accounts are required, the application must ensure accounts designated as temporary in nature shall automatically terminate these accounts after a period of 72 hours. Such a process and capability greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be misused, hijacked, or data compromised.

Note that user authentication and account management should be done via an enterprise-wide mechanism whenever possible.

DAC is a type of access control methodology serving as a means of restricting access to objects and data based on the identity of subjects and/or groups to which they belong. It is discretionary in the sense that application users with the appropriate permissions to access an application resource or data have the discretion to pass that permission on to another user either directly or indirectly.

Data protection requirements may result in a DAC policy being specified as part of the application design. Discretionary access controls would be employed at the application level to restrict and control access to application objects and data thereby providing increased information security for the organization.

When DAC controls are employed, those controls must limit sharing to named application users, groups of users, or both. The application DAC controls must also limit the propagation of access rights and have the ability to exclude access to data down to the granularity of a single user.

Databases using DAC must have the ability for the owner of an object or information to assign or revoke rights to view or modify the object or information.  If the owner of an object or information does not have rights to exclude access to an object or information at a user level, users may gain access to objects and information they are not authorized to view/modify.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Oracle Database 12c</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Oracle Database 12c</dc:subject><dc:identifier>4059</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">V-61577</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">SV-76067</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-002165</ident><fixtext fixref="F-40885r667140_fix">Modify DBMS settings to allow users to assign or revoke access rights to objects and information owned by the user.

The Oracle recommended process for backup and recovery is Oracle RMAN. If Oracle RMAN is deployed, execute the following commands to ensure that the evidence of the implementation of the backup policy includes validating that the files are restorable:

Validating Database Files with BACKUP VALIDATE
--Use the BACKUP VALIDATE command to do the following:
--Check datafiles for physical and logical block corruption
--Confirm that all database files exist and are in the correct locations
--When BACKUP VALIDATE is run, RMAN reads the files to be backed up in their entirety, as it would during a real backup. RMAN does not, however, actually produce any backup sets or image copies.
--Cannot use the BACKUPSET, MAXCORRUPT, or PROXY parameters with BACKUP VALIDATE.
--To validate files with the BACKUP VALIDATE command:
  1. Start RMAN and connect to a target database and recovery catalog (if used).
  2. Run the BACKUP VALIDATE command.

For example, can validate that all database files and archived logs can be backed up by running a command as shown in the following example. This command checks for physical corruptions only.

BACKUP VALIDATE
DATABASE
ARCHIVELOG ALL;

To check for logical corruptions in addition to physical corruptions, run the  following variation of the preceding command:

BACKUP VALIDATE
CHECK LOGICAL
DATABASE
ARCHIVELOG ALL;

In the preceding examples, the RMAN client displays the same output that it would if it were really backing up the files. If RMAN cannot back up one or more of the files, then it issues an error message.

Validating Backups Before Restoring Them

Run RESTORE ... VALIDATE to test whether RMAN can restore a specific file or set of files from a backup. RMAN chooses which backups to use. The database must be mounted or open for this command. Do not have to take datafiles off-line when validating the restore of datafiles, because validation of backups of the datafiles only reads the backups and does not affect the production datafiles. When validating files on disk or tape, RMAN reads all blocks in the backup piece or image copy. RMAN also validates off-site backups. The validation is identical to a real restore operation except that RMAN does not write output files.

To validate backups with the RESTORE command:
1. Run the RESTORE command with the VALIDATE option.

This following example illustrates validating the restore of the database and all archived redo logs:

RESTORE DATABASE VALIDATE;
RESTORE ARCHIVELOG ALL VALIDATE;

If an RMAN error stack is not generated, then skip the subsequent steps. The lack of error messages means that RMAN had confirmed that it can use these backups successfully during a real restore and recovery.

2. If error messages are seen in the output and one is the RMAN-06026 message, then investigate the cause of the problem. If possible, correct the problem that is preventing RMAN from validating the backups and retry the validation. The following error means that RMAN cannot restore one or more of the specified files from available backups:

RMAN-06026: some targets not found - aborting restore
The following sample output shows that RMAN encountered a problem reading the specified backup:

RMAN-03009: failure of restore command on c1 channel at 12-DEC-14 23:22:30

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the successor protocol to Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Although the Oracle configuration parameters have names including 'SSL', such as SSL_VERSION and SSL_CIPHER_SUITES, they refer to TLS.
Use authentication to prove the identities of users who are attempting to log on to the database. Oracle Database enables strong authentication with Oracle authentication adapters that support various third-party authentication services, including TLS with digital certificates, as well as Smart Cards (CAC, PIV).&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Oracle Database 12c</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Oracle Database 12c</dc:subject><dc:identifier>4059</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">V-61703</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">SV-76193</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-000765</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-000766</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-000767</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-000768</ident><fixtext fixref="F-40905r667200_fix">Configure DBMS, OS and/or enterprise-level authentication/access mechanism to require multifactor authentication for user accounts.

A shared authenticator is a generic account used by multiple individuals. Use of a shared authenticator alone does not uniquely identify individual users. An example of a shared authenticator is the UNIX OS 'root' user account, a Windows 'administrator' account, an 'SA' account, or a 'helpdesk' account.

For example, the UNIX and Windows operating systems offer a 'switch user' capability allowing users to authenticate with their individual credentials and, when needed, 'switch' to the administrator role. This method provides for unique individual authentication prior to using a shared authenticator.

Some applications may not have the need to provide a group authenticator; this is considered a matter of application design. In those instances where the application design includes the use of a shared authenticator, this requirement will apply.

There may also be instances when specific user actions need to be performed on the information system without unique user identification or authentication. An example of this type of access is a web server which contains publicly releasable information. These types of accesses are allowed but must be explicitly identified and documented by the organization.

When shared accounts are utilized without another means of identifying individual users, users may deny having performed a particular action.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Oracle Database 12c</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Oracle Database 12c</dc:subject><dc:identifier>4059</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">V-61711</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">SV-76201</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-000764</ident><fixtext fixref="F-40906r667203_fix">Configure DBMS, OS and/or enterprise-level authentication/access mechanism to require individual authentication prior to authentication for shared account access.

(Oracle Access Manager may be helpful in meeting this requirement. Notes on Oracle Access Manager follow.)

Oracle Access Manager is used when there is a need for multifactor authentication of applications front-ending Oracle Datasets that may use group accounts. Oracle Access Manager supports using PKI-based smart cards (CAC, PIV) for multifactor authentication. When a user authenticates to a smart card application, the smart card engine produces a certificate-based authentication token. Can configure a certificate-based authentication scheme in Oracle Access Manager that uses information from the smart card certificate. Certificate-based authentication works with any smart card or similar device that presents an X.509 certificate.

Check:
First, check that the Authentication Module is set up properly:
1) Go to Oracle Access Manager Home Screen and click the Policy Configuration tab.  Select the X509Scheme.
2) Make sure the Authentication Module option is set to X509Plugin.

Second, check that the Authentication policy is using the x509Scheme:
1) Go to Oracle Access Manager Home Screen and click the Policy Configuration tab.
2) Select Application Domains.  Select Search.
3) Select the application domain protecting the Oracle Database.
4) Select the Authentication Polices tab and Click Protected Resource Policy.
5) Make sure the Authentication Scheme is set to x509Scheme.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-237725"><title>SRG-APP-000516-DB-000363</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-237725r667207_rule" weight="10.0" severity="medium"><version>O121-C2-013800</version><title>The DBMS must disable user accounts after 35 days of inactivity.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Attackers that are able to exploit an inactive DBMS account can potentially obtain and maintain undetected access to the database. 

Owners of inactive DBMS accounts will not notice if unauthorized access to their user account has been obtained. All DBMS need to track periods of user inactivity and disable accounts after 35 days of inactivity. Such a process greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be hijacked, leading to a data compromise.
 
To address access requirements, some database administrators choose to integrate their databases with enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements. Such integration allows the database administrator to off-load those access control functions and focus on core application features and functionality. 

This policy does not apply to either emergency accounts or infrequently used accounts. Infrequently used accounts are local logon administrator accounts used by system administrators when network or normal logon/access is not available. Emergency accounts are administrator accounts created in response to crisis situations.

Note that user authentication and account management must be done via an enterprise-wide mechanism whenever possible. Examples of enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Active Directory and LDAP.

For accounts managed by Oracle, check DBMS settings to determine if accounts are automatically disabled by the system after 35 days of inactivity. 

In Oracle 12c, Oracle introduced a new security parameter in the profile called INACTIVE_ACCOUNT_TIME. The INACTIVE_ACCOUNT_TIME parameter specifies the number of days permitted the account will be in OPEN state since the last login, after that will be LOCKED if no successful logins happens after the specified duration.

Check to see what profile each user is associated with, if any, with this query:

select username, profile from dba_users order by 1,2;

Then check the profile to see what the inactive_account_time is set to in the table dba_profiles; the inactive_account_time is a value stored in the LIMIT column, and identified by the value inactive_account_time in the RESOURCE_NAME column.

SQL&gt;select profile, resource_name, resource_type, limit from dba_profiles where upper(resource_name) = 'INACTIVE_ACCOUNT_TIME';

If the INACTIVE_ACCOUNT_TIME parameter is set to UNLIMITED (default) or it is set to more than 35 days, this is a finding.

If INACTIVE_ACCOUNT_TIME is not a parameter associated with the profile then check for a script or an automated job that is run daily that checks the audit trail or other means to make sure every user account has logged in within the last 35 days.  If one is not present, this is a finding.

The storage of passwords in application source or batch job code that is compiled, encoded, or encrypted prevents compliance with password expiration and other management requirements, as well as provides another means for potential discovery.

Oracle provides the capability to provide for a secure external password facility.  Use the Oracle mkstore to create a secure storage area for passwords for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use or deploy a site-authorized facility to perform this function.

Check to see what has been stored in the Oracle External Password Store

To view all contents of a client wallet external password store, check specific credentials by viewing them. Listing the external password store contents provides information can use to decide whether to add or delete credentials from the store.  To list the contents of the external password store, enter the following command at the command line:

  $ mkstore -wrl wallet_location -listCredential

  For example:

  $ mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\12.1.0\db_1\wallets -listCredential

The wallet_location specifies the path to the directory where the wallet, whose external password store contents is to be viewed, is located. This command lists all of the credential database service names (aliases) and the corresponding user name (schema) for that database. Passwords are not listed.

Configuring Clients to Use the External Password Store

If the client is already configured to use external authentication, such as Windows native authentication or Transport Layer Security (TLS), then Oracle Database uses that authentication method. The same credentials used for this type of authentication are typically also used to log on to the database.

For clients not using such authentication methods or wanting to override them for database authentication, can set the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter in sqlnet.ora to TRUE. The default value for SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE is FALSE, allowing standard use of authentication credentials as before.

If wanting a client to use the secure external password store feature, then perform the following configuration task:

 1. Create a wallet on the client by using the following syntax at the command line:

 mkstore -wrl wallet_location -create

    For example:

    mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\12.1.0\db_1\wallets -create
    Enter password: password

The wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet is to be created and stored. This command creates an Oracle wallet with the autologon feature enabled at the location specified. The autologon feature enables the client to access the wallet contents without supplying a password. 

The mkstore utility -create option uses password complexity verification.

 2. Create database connection credentials in the wallet by using the following syntax at the command line:

    mkstore -wrl wallet_location -createCredential db_connect_string username
    Enter password: password

    For example:

    mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\12.1.0\db_1\wallets -createCredential oracle system
    Enter password: password

    In this specification:

The wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet was created.  The db_connect_string used in the CONNECT /@db_connect_string statement must be identical to the db_connect_string specified in the -createCredential command.

The db_connect_string is the TNS alias used to specify the database in the tnsnames.ora file or any service name used to identify the database on an Oracle network. By default, tnsnames.ora is located in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory on UNIX systems and in ORACLE_HOME\network\admin on Windows.

The username is the database logon credential. When prompted, enter the password for this user.

 3. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the WALLET_LOCATION parameter and set it to the directory location of the wallet created in Step 1.  For example, if the wallet was created in
       $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin and Oracle home is set to /private/ora12, then need to enter the following into your client sqlnet.ora file:

    WALLET_LOCATION =
           (SOURCE =
             (METHOD = FILE)
             (METHOD_DATA =
           (DIRECTORY = /private/ora12/network/admin)
           )
          )

 4. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter and set it to TRUE as follows:

       SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE

setting causes all CONNECT /@db_connect_string statements to use the information in the wallet at the specified location to authenticate to databases.

When external authentication is in use, an authenticated user with such a wallet can use the CONNECT /@db_connect_string syntax to access the previously specified databases without providing a user name and password. However, if a user fails that external authentication, then these connect statements also fail.

Below is a sample sqlnet.ora file with the WALLET_LOCATION and the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameters set as described in Steps 3 and 4.

Below is a sample SQLNET.ORA File with Wallet Parameters Set

        WALLET_LOCATION =
            (SOURCE =
              (METHOD = FILE)
              (METHOD_DATA =
            (DIRECTORY = /private/ora12/network/admin)
              )
             )

        SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE
        SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = FALSE
        SSL_VERSION = 1.2

(Note:  this assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in the default location, is in use.  Please see the supplemental file, "Non-default sqlnet.ora configurations.pdf" for how to find multiple and/or differently-located sqlnet.ora files.)</fixtext><fix id="F-40916r667233_fix" /><check system="C-40953r667232_chk"><check-content-ref href="Oracle_Database_12c_STIG.xml" name="M" /><check-content>Review application source code required to be encoded or encrypted for database accounts used by applications or batch jobs to access the database.

The check would depend on the information provided by the DBA.  In a default Oracle installation, all passwords are stored in an encrypted manner.  Ask the DBA if they have created an External Password Store for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use.

Secure External Password Store

Can store password credentials for connecting to databases by using a client-side Oracle wallet. An Oracle wallet is a secure software container that stores authentication and signing credentials.

This wallet usage can simplify large-scale deployments that rely on password credentials for connecting to databases. When this feature is configured, application code, batch jobs, and scripts no longer need embedded user names and passwords. This reduces risk because the passwords are no longer exposed, and password management policies are more easily enforced without changing application code whenever user names or passwords change.

The external password store of the wallet is separate from the area where public key infrastructure (PKI) credentials are stored. Consequently, cannot use Oracle Wallet Manager to manage credentials in the external password store of the wallet. Instead, use the command-line utility mkstore to manage these credentials.

How Does the External Password Store Work?

Typically, users (and as applications, batch jobs, and scripts) connect to databases by using a standard CONNECT statement that specifies a database connection string. This string can include a user name and password, and an Oracle Net service name identifying the database on an Oracle Database network. If the password is omitted, the connection prompts the user for the password.

For example, the service name could be the URL that identifies that database, or a TNS alias entered in the tnsnames.ora file in the database. Another possibility is a host:port:sid string.

The following examples are standard CONNECT statements that could be used for a client that is not configured to use the external password store:

  CONNECT salesapp@sales_db.us.example.com
  Enter password: password

  CONNECT salesapp@orasales
  Enter password: password

  CONNECT salesapp@ourhost37:1527:DB17
  Enter password: password

In these examples, salesapp is the user name, with the unique connection string for the database shown as specified in three different ways. Could use its URL sales_db.us.example.com, or its TNS alias, orasales, from the tnsnames.ora file, or its host:port:sid string.

However, when clients are configured to use the secure external password store, applications can connect to a database with the following CONNECT statement syntax, without specifying database logon credentials:

  CONNECT /@db_connect_string

  CONNECT /@db_connect_string AS SYSDBA

  CONNECT /@db_connect_string AS SYSOPER
  
In this specification, db_connect_string is a valid connection string to access the intended database, such as the service name, URL, or alias as shown in the earlier examples. Each user account must have its own unique connection string; cannot create one connection string for multiple users.

In this case, the database credentials, user name and password, are securely stored in an Oracle wallet created for this purpose. The autologon feature of this wallet is turned on, so the system does not need a password to open the wallet. From the wallet, it gets the credentials to access the database for the user they represent.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-237735"><title>SRG-APP-000164-DB-000401</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-237735r708389_rule" weight="10.0" severity="medium"><version>O121-C2-015200</version><title>The DBMS must enforce password maximum lifetime restrictions.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Password maximum lifetime is the maximum period of time, (typically in days) a user's password may be in effect before the user is forced to change it.

Check the following settings to see if FIPS 140-2 encryption is configured. If encryption is not configured, check with the DBA and SYSTEM Administrator to see if other mechanisms or third-party products are deployed to encrypt data during the transmission or storage of data.

For Transparent Data Encryption and DBMS_CRYPTO:

To see if Oracle is configured for FIPS 140-2 Transparent Data Encryption and/or DBMS_CRYPTO, enter the following SQL*Plus command:
SHOW PARAMETER DBFIPS_140
or the following SQL query:
SELECT * FROM SYS.V$PARAMETER WHERE NAME = 'DBFIPS_140';

If Oracle returns the value 'FALSE', or returns no rows, this is a finding.

To see if Oracle is configured for FIPS 140-2 SSL/TLS authentication and/or Encryption:

select * from V_$VERSION;

If the version displayed for Oracle Database is lower than 12.1.0.2, this is a finding.

If the operating system is Windows and the DBMS version is 12.1.0.2, use the opatch command to display the patches applied to the DBMS.

In order to preserve availability, it is important for the DBMS to terminate suspicious events with the least disruptive action possible.

The inclusion of role is intended to address those situations where an access control policy, such as Role Based Access Control (RBAC), is being implemented and where a change of role provides the same degree of assurance in the change of access authorizations for both the user and all processes acting on behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between a privileged and non-privileged account.

To limit exposure when operating from within a privileged account or role, the application must support organizational requirements that users of information system accounts, or roles, with access to organization-defined lists of security functions or security-relevant information, use non-privileged accounts, or roles, when accessing other (non-security) system functions.

Use of privileged accounts for non-administrative purposes puts data at risk of unintended or unauthorized loss, modification, or exposure. In particular, DBA accounts if used for non-administration application development or application maintenance can lead to miss-assignment of privileges where privileges are inherited by object owners. It may also lead to loss or compromise of application data where the elevated privileges bypass controls designed in and provided by applications.

The DBMS software installation account may require privileges not required for database administration or other functions. Use of accounts configured with excess privileges may result in the loss or compromise of data or system settings due to elevated privileges that bypass controls designed to protect them.

This requirement is particularly important because Oracle equates the installation account with the SYS account - the super-DBA.  Once logged on to the operating system, this account can connect to the database AS SYSDBA without further authentication.  It is very powerful and, by virtue of not being linked to any one person, cannot be audited to the level of the individual.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Oracle Database 12c</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Oracle Database 12c</dc:subject><dc:identifier>4059</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">V-61865</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/legacy">SV-76355</ident><ident system="http://cyber.mil/cci">CCI-001499</ident><fixtext fixref="F-40927r667266_fix">Restrict interactive use of the DBMS software installation account to DBMS software installation, upgrade, and maintenance actions only.

If the application were to allow any user to make changes to software libraries, then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a robust change management process.

This requirement is contingent upon the language in which the application is programmed, as many application architectures in use today incorporate their software libraries into, and make them inseparable from, their compiled distributions, rendering them static and version-dependent.
