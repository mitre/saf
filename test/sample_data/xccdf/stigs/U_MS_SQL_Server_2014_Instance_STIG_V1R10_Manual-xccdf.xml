For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain types of packets to protect devices on an organization’s internal network from being directly affected by DoS attacks.

One way SQL Server can limit exposure to DoS attacks is to restrict the number of connections that can be opened by a single user. SQL Server supports this through the use of logon triggers. (Note, however, that this need not be the only, or even the principal, means for satisfying this requirement. Depending on the architecture and capabilities of the network and application, a network device or an application may be more suitable for providing this protection.)

When determining the appropriate values for this limit, take the characteristics of the various kinds of user into account, and bear in mind that some applications and some users may need to have multiple sessions open. For example, while a standard account using a simple application may never need more than, say, five connections, a database administrator using SQL Server Management Studio may need significantly more, because each tab in that application counts as a distinct session.

Architectural note: In SQL Server, a count of active sessions by user can be obtained from one of the dynamic management views. For example:
      SELECT original_login_name, count(*)
      FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions
      WHERE is_user_process = 1
      GROUP BY original_login_name;
However, for this to return an accurate count in a logon trigger, the user would have to have the View Server State privilege. (Without this privilege, the trigger sees information only about the current session, so would always return a count of one.) View Server State would give that user access to a wide swath of information about the server.  One way to avoid this exposure is to create a summary table, and a view of that table that restricts each user to seeing his/her own count, and establish a frequently-run background job to refresh the table (using the above query or similar).

A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential oversight or other error. Managing accounts for the same person in multiple places is inefficient and prone to problems with consistency and synchronization.

A comprehensive application account management process that includes automation helps to ensure that accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed. 

Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended, or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores, such as multiple servers. Account management functions can also include: assignment of group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephone notification to report atypical system account usage.

Account management and authentication in a Windows environment normally use an LDAP-compatible directory service, usually Windows Active Directory.  This in turn, in the DoD environment, is typically integrated with the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).  Additional technologies or products may be employed that when placed together constitute an overall mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements.  An example is the use of Group Policy Objects to enforce rules concerning passwords.

SQL Server must be configured to use Windows authentication, with SQL Server authentication disabled.  If circumstances (such as the architecture of a purchased application) make it necessary to have SQL Server authentication available, its use must be kept to a minimum.  The reasons for its use, and the measures taken to restrict it to only the necessary cases, must be documented, with AO approval.

It is assumed throughout this STIG that this integration has been implemented.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target SQL Server Installation 2014</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>SQL Server Installation 2014</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2639</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-000015</ident><fixtext fixref="F-73873r1_fix">If mixed mode is required, document the need and justification; describe the measures taken to ensure the use of SQL Server authentication is kept to a minimum; describe the measures taken to safeguard passwords; list or describe the SQL Logins used; obtain official approval.

To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DoD-approved PKIs, all DoD systems, including SQL Server instances, must be properly configured to implement access control policies. 

Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. 

Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system. 

This requirement is applicable to access control enforcement applications, a category that includes SQL Server.  If SQL Server is not configured to follow applicable policy when approving access, it may be in conflict with networks or other applications in the information system. This may result in users either gaining or being denied access inappropriately and in conflict with applicable policy.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target SQL Server Installation 2014</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>SQL Server Installation 2014</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2639</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-000213</ident><fixtext fixref="F-73875r1_fix">Use GRANT, REVOKE, DENY, ALTER SERVER ROLE … ADD MEMBER …  and/or  ALTER SERVER ROLE  ….

Examples of particular actions taken by individuals include creating information, sending a message, approving information (e.g., indicating concurrence or signing a contract), and receiving a message.

Non-repudiation protects against later claims by a user of not having created, modified, or deleted a particular data item or collection of data in the database.

Use of shared accounts does not provide individual accountability for actions taken on the DBMS or data. Whenever a single database account is used to connect to the database, a secondary authentication method that provides individual accountability is required. This scenario most frequently occurs when an externally hosted application authenticates individual users to the application and the application uses a single account to retrieve or update database information on behalf of the individual users (as in connection pooling).

When shared accounts are utilized without another means of identifying individual users, users may deny having performed a particular action.

Therefore, it must be possible to configure auditing to do this. DBMSs typically make such information available through views or functions.

This requirement addresses explicit requests for privilege/permission/role membership information. It does not refer to the implicit retrieval of privileges/permissions/role memberships that the DBMS continually performs to determine if any and every action on the database is permitted.

To aid in diagnosis, it is necessary to keep track of failed attempts in addition to the successful ones.

Use of SQL Server Audit is recommended.  All features of SQL Server Audit are available in the Enterprise and Developer editions of SQL Server 2014.  It is not available at the database level in other editions.  For this or legacy reasons, the instance may be using SQL Server Trace for auditing, which remains an acceptable solution for the time being.  Note, however, that Microsoft intends to remove most aspects of Trace at some point after SQL Server 2016.

This requirement applies to SQL Server Audit-based audit trails; Trace does not have this capability.

Use of SQL Server Audit's SCHEMA_OBJECT_ACCESS_GROUP causes capture of all accesses, successful and otherwise, to the system views (and all other schema-scoped objects).  The [Succeeded] column in the audit output indicates the success or failure of the attempted action.  Be aware, however, that it may report True in some cases where one would intuitively expect False.  For example, SELECT 1/0 FROM SYS.ALL_OBJECTS will appear in the audit trail as successful, if the user has permission to perform that action, even though it contains an invalid expression.  Some other actions that one would consider failures (such as selecting from a table that does not exist) may not appear at all.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target SQL Server Installation 2014</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>SQL Server Installation 2014</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2639</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-000172</ident><fixtext fixref="F-73885r1_fix">Design and deploy a SQL Server Audit that captures all auditable events.

This requires specific information regarding the outcome of the action or event that the audit record is referring to. If outcome status information is not recorded and stored with the audit record, the record itself is of very limited use.

Success and failure indicators ascertain the outcome of a particular event. As such, they also provide a means to measure the impact of an event and help authorized personnel to determine the appropriate response. Without knowing the outcome of audit events, it is very difficult to accurately recreate the series of events during forensic analysis.

Use of SQL Server Audit is recommended.  All features of SQL Server Audit are available in the Enterprise and Developer editions of SQL Server 2014.  It is not available at the database level in other editions.

If Trace is enabled for auditing, SQL Server does capture the outcome status information in all audit records.

If SQL Server Audit is enabled, the [Succeeded] column in the audit output indicates the success or failure of the attempted action.

SQL Server does have a means available to add organizationally defined additional, more detailed information in the audit event records. These events may be identified by type, location, or subject. An example of more detailed information the organization may require in audit records could be the name of the application where the request is coming from.

When availability is an overriding concern, approved actions in response to an audit failure are as follows: 

(i) If the failure was caused by the lack of audit record storage capacity, the DBMS must continue generating audit records, if possible (automatically restarting the audit service if necessary), preferably overwriting the oldest audit records in a first-in-first-out manner.

(ii) If audit records are sent to a centralized collection server and communication with this server is lost or the server fails, the DBMS must queue audit records locally until communication is restored or until the audit records are retrieved manually.

In addition, access to audit records provides information an attacker could potentially use to his or her advantage.

To ensure the veracity of audit data, the information system and/or the application must protect audit information from any and all unauthorized access. This includes read, write, copy, etc.

SQL Server and third-party tools are examples of applications that are easily able to view and manipulate audit file data. Additionally, applications with user interfaces to audit records should not allow unfettered manipulation of, or access to, those records via any application. If an application provides access to the audit data, the application becomes accountable for ensuring that audit information is protected from unauthorized access.

This requirement can be achieved through multiple methods, which will depend upon system architecture and design. Some commonly employed methods include ensuring log files enjoy the proper file system permissions utilizing file system protections, and limiting log data location.

Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target SQL Server Installation 2014</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>SQL Server Installation 2014</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2639</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-000162</ident><fixtext fixref="F-73905r2_fix">Edit the system security plan to include justification and authorization for any less restrictive permissions that are present and needed.

Modify audit file permissions to meet the requirement to protect against unauthorized access.

Navigate to audit folder location(s) using a command prompt or Windows Explorer. Right-click on the file, click Properties.
On the Security tab, modify the security permissions to:
Administrator(read)

SQL Server Service SID OR Service Account (Full Control) [Notes 1, 2]
SQL Server SQL Agent Service SID OR Service Account, if SQL Server Agent is in use. (Read, Execute, Write) [Notes 1, 2]

-----

Note 1: It is highly advisable to use a separate account for each service. When installing SQL Server in single-server mode, you can opt to have these provisioned for you. These automatically-generated accounts are referred to as virtual accounts. Each virtual account has an equivalent Service SID, with the same name. The installer also creates an equivalent SQL Server login, also with the same name. Applying folder and file permissions to Service SIDs, rather than to domain accounts or local computer accounts, provides tighter control, because these permissions are available only to the specific service when it is running, and not in any other context. (However, when using failover clustering, a domain account must be specified at installation, rather than a virtual account.) For more on this topic, see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms143504(v=sql.120).aspx.

Note 2: Tips for adding a service SID/virtual account to a folder's permission list.
1) In Windows Explorer, right-click on the folder and select "Properties."
2) Select the "Security" tab
3) Click "Edit"
4) Click "Add"
5) Click "Locations"
6) Select the computer name
7) Search for the name
7.a) SQL Server Service
7.a.i) Type "NT SERVICE\MSSQL" and click "Check Names". (What you have just typed in is the first 16 characters of the name. At least one character must follow "NT SERVICE\"; you will be presented with a list of all matches. If you have typed in the full, correct name, step 7.a.ii is bypassed.)

Note 1: It is highly advisable to use a separate account for each service. When installing SQL Server in single-server mode, you can opt to have these provisioned for you. These automatically-generated accounts are referred to as virtual accounts. Each virtual account has an equivalent Service SID, with the same name. The installer also creates an equivalent SQL Server login, also with the same name. Applying folder and file permissions to Service SIDs, rather than to domain accounts or local computer accounts, provides tighter control, because these permissions are available only to the specific service when it is running, and not in any other context. (However, when using failover clustering, a domain account must be specified at installation, rather than a virtual account.)

Multiple applications can provide a cumulative negative effect. A vulnerability and subsequent exploit of one application can lead to an exploit of other applications sharing the same security context. For example, an exploit of a web server process that leads to unauthorized administrative access to host system directories can most likely lead to a compromise of all applications hosted by the same system. Database software not installed using dedicated directories both threatens and is threatened by other hosted applications. Access controls defined for one application may by default provide access to other applications’ database objects or directories.

From a Command Prompt, type regedit.exe, and press [ENTER].

Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE &gt;&gt; SOFTWARE &gt;&gt; Microsoft &gt;&gt; Microsoft SQL Server &gt;&gt; Instance Names. Each instance installed on the server possesses a key inside a folder under this registry entry.

Analysis Services Instances are registered in the OLAP subfolder.
Reporting Services Instances are registered in the RS subfolder.
Standard SQL Server (database engine) Instances are registered in the SQL subfolder.

Inside each one of these folders, a single key is used to reference an Instance's specific Windows Registry tree. Each key will have its own registry tree at the following registry location: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE &gt;&gt; SOFTWARE &gt;&gt; Microsoft &gt;&gt; Microsoft SQL Server &gt;&gt; [INSTANCE NAME].

An [INSTANCE NAME] is listed as the Data component of a key found in one of the above OLAP, RS, or SQL folders.

To find the installation location of a particular instance, navigate to the following location in the Windows Registry:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE &gt;&gt; SOFTWARE &gt;&gt; Microsoft &gt;&gt; Microsoft SQL Server &gt;&gt; [INSTANCE NAME] &gt;&gt; Setup. Examine the value of the 'SqlProgramDir' key. The value of the 'SqlProgramDir' key is the SQL Server installation directory for that SQL Server Instance.

Navigate to that folder location using a Command Prompt or Windows Explorer. Only applications that are required for the functioning and administration, not use, of SQL Server should be located on the same directory node as the SQL Server software libraries.

System documentation should include a definition of the functionality considered privileged.

Depending on circumstances, privileged functions can include, for example, establishing accounts, performing system integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals that do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users.

A privileged function in the DBMS/database context is any operation that modifies the structure of the database, its built-in logic, or its security settings. This would include all Data Definition Language (DDL) statements and all security-related statements. In SQL Server, it encompasses, but is not necessarily limited to: 
CREATE
ALTER
DROP
GRANT
REVOKE
DENY

There may also be Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements that, subject to context, should be regarded as privileged. Possible examples include:

TRUNCATE TABLE;
DELETE, or
DELETE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or
DELETE without a WHERE clause;

UPDATE or
UPDATE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or
UPDATE without a WHERE clause;

any SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE to an application-defined security table executed by other than a security principal.

Depending on the design of the database and associated applications, the prevention of unauthorized use of privileged functions may be achieved by means of DBMS security features, database triggers, other mechanisms, or a combination of these.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target SQL Server Installation 2014</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>SQL Server Installation 2014</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2639</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-002235</ident><fixtext fixref="F-74001r1_fix">Use REVOKE and/or DENY and/or ALTER SERVER ROLE ...

To assist in conducting reviews of permissions, the following views and permissions are defined in the supplemental file Permissions.sql, provided with this STIG:
database_permissions
database_role_members
server_permissions
server_role_members
database_effective_permissions('&lt;database user/role name&gt;')
database_roles_of('&lt;database user/role name&gt;')

server_effective_permissions('&lt;server login/role name&gt;')
server_roles_of('&lt;server login/role name&gt;')

Permissions of concern in this respect include the following, and possibly others:
- any server permission except CONNECT SQL, but including CONNECT ANY DATABASE
- any database permission beginning with "CREATE" or "ALTER"
- CONTROL
- INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, EXECUTE on locally-defined tables and procedures designed for supplemental configuration and security purposes.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-67903"><title>SRG-APP-000381-DB-000361</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-82393r3_rule" severity="medium" weight="10.0"><version>SQL4-00-034000</version><title>SQL Server must produce Trace or Audit records of its enforcement of access restrictions associated with changes to the configuration of the DBMS or database(s).</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Without auditing the enforcement of access restrictions against changes to configuration, it would be difficult to identify attempted attacks and an audit trail would not be available for forensic investigation for after-the-fact actions. 

Enforcement actions are the methods or mechanisms used to prevent unauthorized changes to configuration settings. Enforcement action methods may be as simple as denying access to a file based on the application of file permissions (access restriction). Audit items may consist of lists of actions blocked by access restrictions or changes identified after the fact.

Use of SQL Server Audit is recommended.  All features of SQL Server Audit are available in the Enterprise and Developer editions of SQL Server 2014.  It is not available at the database level in other editions.

If SQL Server Audit is in use, proceed as follows.

The basic SQL Server Audit configuration provided in the supplemental file Audit.sql uses broad, server-level audit action groups for this purpose.  SQL Server Audit's flexibility makes other techniques possible.  If an alternative technique is in use and demonstrated effective, this is not a finding.

Determine the name(s) of the server audit specification(s) in use.

To look at audits and audit specifications, in Management Studio's object explorer, expand 
&lt;server name&gt; &gt;&gt; Security &gt;&gt; Audits
and
&lt;server name&gt; &gt;&gt; Security &gt;&gt; Server Audit Specifications.
Also, 
&lt;server name&gt; &gt;&gt; Databases &gt;&gt; &lt;database name&gt; &gt;&gt; Security &gt;&gt; Database Audit Specifications.

Alternatively, review the contents of the system views with "audit" in their names.

Run the following code to verify that all configuration-related actions are being audited:
USE [master];
GO
SELECT * FROM sys.server_audit_specification_details WHERE server_specification_id =
(SELECT server_specification_id FROM sys.server_audit_specifications WHERE [name] = '&lt;server_audit_specification_name&gt;')

Use of SQL Server Audit's SCHEMA_OBJECT_ACCESS_GROUP causes capture of all accesses, successful and otherwise, to all schema-scoped objects.  The [Succeeded] column in the audit output indicates the success or failure of the attempted action.

DELETE without a WHERE clause;

UPDATE or

It avoids the need to hard-assign port numbers to the instances and to set and maintain those port numbers in client systems.  It enables administrators and authorized users to discover database management system instances, and the databases they support, over the network.

This convenience also presents the possibility of unauthorized individuals gaining knowledge of the available SQL Server resources.  Therefore, it is necessary to consider whether the SQL Server Browser is needed.  Typically, if only a single instance is installed, using the default name (MSSQLSERVER) and port assignment (1433), the Browser is not adding any value.   The more complex the installation, the more likely SQL Server Browser is to be helpful.
