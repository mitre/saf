The mount (and umount ) system call controls the mounting and unmounting of file systems. The parameters below configure the system to create an audit record when the mount system call is used by a non-privileged user\n\nNote: Systems may have been customized to change the default UID_MIN. To confirm the UID_MIN for your system, run the following command:\n\n# awk '/^s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs\n\nIf your systems' UID_MIN is not 1000, replace audit>=1000 with audit>=<UID_MIN for your system> in the Audit and Remediation procedures.\n\nRationale:\n\nIt is highly unusual for a non privileged user to mount file systems to the system. While tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open , creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is beyond the scope of this document.\n\nSolution:\nFor 32 bit systems Edit or create a file in the /etc/audit/rules.d/ directory ending in .rules\nExample: vi /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules\nand add the following lines:\n\n-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k mounts\n\nFor 64 bit systems Edit or create a file in the /etc/audit/rules.d/ directory ending in .rules\nExample: vi /etc/audit/rules.d/mounts.rules\nand add the following lines:\n\n-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k mounts\n-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k mounts\n\nNotes:\n\nThis tracks successful and unsuccessful mount commands.

The init_module (load a module) and delete_module (delete a module) system calls control loading and unloading of modules. Any execution of the loading and unloading module programs and system calls will trigger an audit record with an identifier of 'modules'.\n\nRationale:\n\nMonitoring the use of insmod , rmmod and modprobe could provide system administrators with evidence that an unauthorized user loaded or unloaded a kernel module, possibly compromising the security of the system. Monitoring of the init_module and delete_module system calls would reflect an unauthorized user attempting to use a different program to load and unload modules.\n\nSolution:\nFor 32 bit systems Edit or create a file in the /etc/audit/rules.d/ directory ending in .rules\nExample: vi /etc/audit/rules.d/modules.rules\nand add the following lines:\n\n-w /sbin/insmod -p x -k modules\n-w /sbin/rmmod -p x -k modules\n-w /sbin/modprobe -p x -k modules\n-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S init_module -S delete_module -k modules\n\nFor 64 bit systems Edit or create a file in the /etc/audit/rules.d/ directory ending in .rules\nExample: vi /etc/audit/rules.d/modules.rules\nand add the following lines:\n\n-w /sbin/insmod -p x -k modules\n-w /sbin/rmmod -p x -k modules\n-w /sbin/modprobe -p x -k modules\n-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S init_module -S delete_module -k modules\n\nNotes:\n\nReloading the auditd config to set active settings requires the auditd service to be restarted, and may require a system reboot.\n\nSee Also: https://workbench.cisecurity.org/files/2611\n\nReference: 800-171|3.3.1,800-171|3.3.2,800-53|AU-12,CN-L3|7.1.3.3(a),CN-L3|7.1.3.3(b),CN-L3|7.1.3.3(c),CN-L3|8.1.3.5(a),CN-L3|8.1.3.5(b),CN-L3|8.1.4.3(a),CSCv6|3,CSCv7|5.1,CSF|DE.CM-1,CSF|DE.CM-3,CSF|DE.CM-7,CSF|PR.PT-1,ISO/IEC-27001|A.12.4.1,ITSG-33|AU-12,LEVEL|2S,NESA|T3.6.2,NESA|T3.6.5,NESA|T3.6.6,NIAv2|SM8,QCSC-v1|13.2,QCSC-v1|3.2,QCSC-v1|6.2,QCSC-v1|8.2.1,SWIFT-CSCv1|6.4,TBA-FIISB|45.1.1\n\nPolicy Value:\ncmd: /sbin/auditctl -l | /bin/grep -P '^-a[\\s]+always,exit[\\s]+-F[\\s]+arch=b64[\\s]+-S[\\s]+(?=.*init_module)(?=.*delete_module).*-F[\\s]+key=modules$' | /usr/bin/awk '{print} END {if (NR != 0) print \"pass\" ; else print \"fail\"}'\nexpect: pass\nsystem: Linux\n\nActual Value:\nThe command '/sbin/auditctl -l | /bin/grep -P '^-a[\\s]+always,exit[\\s]+-F[\\s]+arch=b64[\\s]+-S[\\s]+(?=.*init_module)(?=.*delete_module).*-F[\\s]+key=modules$' | /usr/bin/awk '{print} END {if (NR != 0) print \"pass\" ; else print \"fail\"}'' returned : \n\nfail",

It can be used for adding encryption to legacy applications, going through firewalls, and some system administrators and IT professionals use it for opening backdoors into the internal network from their home machines\n\nRationale:\n\nLeaving port forwarding enabled can expose the organization to security risks and back-doors.\n\nSSH connections are protected with strong encryption. This makes their contents invisible to most deployed network monitoring and traffic filtering solutions. This invisibility carries considerable risk potential if it is used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration. Cybercriminals or malware could exploit SSH to hide their unauthorized communications, or to exfiltrate stolen data from the target network\n\nSolution:\nEdit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows:\n\nAllowTcpForwarding no\n\nImpact:\n\nSSH tunnels are widely used in many corporate environments that employ mainframe systems as their application backends. In those environments the applications themselves may have very limited native support for security. By utilizing tunneling, compliance with SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and other standards can be achieved without having to modify the applications.\n\nDefault Value:\n\nAllowTcpForwarding yes\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://www.ssh.com/ssh/tunneling/example\n\nSee Also: https://workbench.cisecurity.org/files/2611\n\nReference: 800-171|3.4.2,800-53|CM-6,CN-L3|8.1.10.6(d),CSCv7|9.2,CSF|PR.IP-1,ITSG-33|CM-6,LEVEL|2S,NESA|T3.2.1,SWIFT-CSCv1|2.3\n\nPolicy Value:\nexpect: ^[\\s]*AllowTcpForwarding[\\s]+no[\\s]*$\nfile: /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nregex: ^[\\s]*AllowTcpForwarding[\\s]\nsystem: Linux\n\nActual Value:\nCompliant file(s):\n      /etc/ssh/sshd_config - regex '^[\\s]*AllowTcpForwarding[\\s]' found - expect '^[\\s]*AllowTcpForwarding[\\s]+no[\\s]*$' found in the following lines:\n          63: AllowTcpForwarding no",

One of these, the --verify option, can be used to verify that system packages are correctly installed. The --verify option can be used to verify a particular package or to verify all system packages. If no output is returned, the package is installed correctly. The following table describes the meaning of output from the verify option:\n\nCode   Meaning\n\nS      File size differs.\n\nM      File mode differs (includes permissions and file type).\n\n5      The MD5 checksum differs.\n\nD      The major and minor version numbers differ on a device file.\n\nL      A mismatch occurs in a link.\n\nU      The file ownership differs.\n\nG      The file group owner differs.\n\nT      The file time (mtime) differs.\n\nThe dpkg -S command can be used to determine which package a particular file belongs to. For example the following command determines which package the /bin/bash file belongs to:\n\n# dpkg -S /bin/bash\n\n\n\nbash: /bin/bash\n\n\n\n\nTo verify the settings for the package that controls the /bin/bash file, run the following:\n\n# dpkg --verify bash\n\n\n\n??5?????? c /etc/bash.bashrc\n\nRationale:\n\nIt is important to confirm that packaged system files and directories are maintained with the permissions they were intended to have from the OS vendor.\n\nNOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance.\n\nSolution:\nCorrect any discrepancies found and rerun the audit until output is clean or risk is mitigated or accepted.\n\nNotes:\n\nSince packages and important files may change with new updates and releases, it is recommended to verify everything, not just a finite list of files. This can be a time consuming task and results may depend on site policy therefore it is not a scorable benchmark item, but is provided for those interested in additional security measures.\n\nSome of the recommendations of this benchmark alter the state of files audited by this recommendation. The audit command will alert for all changes to a file permissions even if the new state is more secure than the default.\n\nSee Also: https://workbench.cisecurity.org/files/2611\n\nReference: CSCv6|14.4,CSCv7|14.6,LEVEL|2NS\n\nPolicy Value:\nWARNING",
