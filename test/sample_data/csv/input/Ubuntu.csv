The control of information in shared resources is also commonly referred to as object reuse and residual information protection.

This requirement generally applies to the design of an information technology product, but it can also apply to the configuration of particular information system components that are, or use, such products. This can be verified by acceptance/validation processes in DoD or other government agencies.

There may be shared resources with configurable protections (e.g., files in storage) that may be assessed on specific information system components.","","Verify that all public (world writeable) directories have the public sticky bit set.

Find world-writable directories that lack the sticky bit by running the following command: 

# sudo find / -type d -perm -002 ! -perm -1000

Without the capability to generate audit records, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

Audit record content that may be necessary to satisfy this requirement includes, for example, time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, filenames involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked.

Reconstruction of harmful events or forensic analysis is not possible if audit records do not contain enough information.

Successful incident response and auditing relies on timely, accurate system information and analysis in order to allow the organization to identify and respond to potential incidents in a proficient manner. If the operating system does not provide the ability to centrally review the operating system logs, forensic analysis is negatively impacted.

Associating event types with detected events in the Ubuntu operating system audit logs provides a means of investigating an attack; recognizing resource utilization or capacity thresholds; or identifying an improperly configured operating system.

Responses to audit failure depend upon the nature of the failure mode.

When availability is an overriding concern, other approved actions in response to an audit failure are as follows: 

1) If the failure was caused by the lack of audit record storage capacity, the Ubuntu operating system must continue generating audit records if possible (automatically restarting the audit service if necessary), overwriting the oldest audit records in a first-in-first-out manner.

2) If audit records are sent to a centralized collection server and communication with this server is lost or the server fails, the Ubuntu operating system must queue audit records locally until communication is restored or until the audit records are retrieved manually.

The task of allocating audit record storage capacity is usually performed during initial installation of the Ubuntu operating system.","","Verify the Ubuntu operating system allocates audit record storage capacity to store at least one week's worth of audit records when audit records are not immediately sent to a central audit record storage facility.

Determine which partition the audit records are being written to with the following command:

# sudo grep log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf
log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log

Check the size of the partition that audit records are written to (with the example being /var/log/audit/) with the following command:

# df –h /var/log/audit/
/dev/sda2 24G 10.4G 13.6G 43% /var/log/audit

If the audit records are not written to a partition made specifically for audit records (/var/log/audit is a separate partition), determine the amount of space being used by other files in the partition with the following command:

#du –sh [audit_partition]
1.8G /var/log/audit

Note: The partition size needed to capture a week's worth of audit records is based on the activity level of the system and the total storage capacity available. In normal circumstances, 10.0 GB of storage space for audit records will be sufficient.

If audit records are not stored on a partition made specifically for audit records, a new partition with sufficient amount of space will need be to be created.

Set the auditd server to point to the mount point where the audit records must be located:

A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user access) without terminating network sessions.

Session termination terminates all processes associated with a user's logical session except those processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated.

Terminating an idle session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended. In addition, quickly terminating an idle session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element. 

Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level, and de-allocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. This does not mean that the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the inactive session and releases the resources associated with that session.

Conditions or trigger events requiring automatic session termination can include, for example, organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, and time-of-day restrictions on information system use.

Check the firewall configuration for any unnecessary or prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and/or services by running the following command:

# sudo ufw show raw

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)

Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 1 packets, 40 bytes)

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
 pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
 pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination

Ask the system administrator for the site or program PPSM CLSA. Verify the services allowed by the firewall match the PPSM Component Local Services Assessment (CLSA).

By default, SSHD binds the forwarding server to the loopback address and sets the hostname part of the DIPSLAY environment variable to localhost. This prevents remote hosts from connecting to the proxy display.","","Verify the SSH daemon prevents remote hosts from connecting to the proxy display.

Check the SSH X11UseLocalhost setting with the following command:

X11UseLocalhost yes

Edit the ""/etc/ssh/sshd_config"" file to uncomment or add the line for the ""X11UseLocalhost"" keyword and set its value to ""yes"" (this file may be named differently or be in a different location if using a version of SSH that is provided by a third-party vendor):
