Users should also ensure that the system has plenty of entropy during the installation process by moving the mouse around, or if no mouse is available, ensuring that many keystrokes are typed. The recommended amount of keystrokes is 256 and more. Less than 256 keystrokes may generate a non-unique key. Install the dracut-fips package with the following command: # yum install dracut-fips Recreate the \"initramfs\" file with the following command: Note: This command will overwrite the existing \"initramfs\" file. # dracut -f Modify the kernel command line of the current kernel in the \"grub.cfg\" file by adding the following option to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX key in the \"/etc/default/grub\" file and then rebuild the \"grub.cfg\" file: fips=1 Changes to \"/etc/default/grub\" require rebuilding the \"grub.cfg\" file as follows: On BIOS-based machines, use the following command: # grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg On UEFI-based machines, use the following command: # grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg If /boot or /boot/efi reside on separate partitions, the kernel parameter boot=&lt;partition of /boot or /boot/efi&gt; must be added to the kernel command line. You can identify a partition by running the df /boot or df /boot/efi command: # df /boot Filesystem 1K-blocks Used Available Use% Mounted on /dev/sda1 495844 53780 416464 12% /boot To ensure the \"boot=\" configuration option will work even if device naming changes occur between boots, identify the universally unique identifier (UUID) of the partition with the following command: # blkid /dev/sda1 /dev/sda1: UUID=\"05c000f1-a213-759e-c7a2-f11b7424c797\" TYPE=\"ext4\" For the example above, append the following string to the kernel command line: boot=UUID=05c000f1-a213-759e-c7a2-f11b7424c797 Reboot the system for the changes to take effect."

If another host-based intrusion detection application is in use, such as SELinux, this must be documented and approved by the local Authorizing Official. Procedure: Examine the system to determine if the Host Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) is installed: # rpm -qa | grep MFEhiplsm Verify that the McAfee HIPS module is active on the system: # ps -ef | grep -i “hipclient” If the MFEhiplsm package is not installed, check for another intrusion detection system: # find / -name &lt;daemon name&gt; Where &lt;daemon name&gt; is the name of the primary application daemon to determine if the application is loaded on the system. Determine if the application is active on the system: # ps -ef | grep -i &lt;daemon name&gt; If the MFEhiplsm package is not installed and an alternate host-based intrusion detection application has not been documented for use, this is a finding. If no host-based intrusion detection system is installed and running on the system, this is a finding."
