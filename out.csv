that a file integrity tool verifies the baseline operating system configuration
at least weekly.","Unauthorized changes to the baseline configuration could make the

operating system. Changes to operating system configurations can have
unintended side effects, some of which may be relevant to security.

    Detecting such changes and providing an automated response can help avoid
unintended, negative consequences that could ultimately affect the security

Officer (IMO)/Information System Security Officer (ISSO) and System

when there is an unauthorized modification of a configuration item.

rationale: 

check: Verify the operating system routinely checks the baseline configuration for
unauthorized changes.

    Note: A file integrity tool other than Advanced Intrusion Detection
Environment (AIDE) may be used, but the tool must be executed at least once per
week.

    Check to see if AIDE is installed on the system with the following command:

    # yum list installed aide

    If AIDE is not installed, ask the SA how file integrity checks are
performed on the system.

    Check for the presence of a cron job running daily or weekly on the system
that executes AIDE daily to scan for changes to the system baseline. The
command used in the example will use a daily occurrence.

    Check the cron directories for a script file controlling the execution of
the file integrity application. For example, if AIDE is installed on the
system, use the following command:

    # ls -al /etc/cron.* | grep aide
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 29 Nov 22 2015 aide

    # grep aide /etc/crontab /var/spool/cron/root
    /etc/crontab: 30 04 * * * /root/aide
    /var/spool/cron/root: 30 04 * * * /root/aide

    If the file integrity application does not exist, or a script file
controlling the execution of the file integrity application does not exist,
this is a finding.

fix: Configure the file integrity tool to run automatically on the system at
least weekly. The following example output is generic. It will set cron to run
AIDE daily, but other file integrity tools may be used:

    # more /etc/cron.daily/aide
    #!/bin/bash

rationale: 

check: Verify the file integrity tool is configured to use FIPS 140-2 approved
cryptographic hashes for validating file contents and directories.

    Note: If RHEL-07-021350 is a finding, this is automatically a finding too
as the system cannot implement FIPS 140-2 approved cryptographic algorithms and
hashes.

    Check to see if Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) is
installed on the system with the following command:

    # yum list installed aide

    If AIDE is not installed, ask the System Administrator how file integrity
checks are performed on the system.

    If there is no application installed to perform file integrity checks, this
is a finding.

    Note: AIDE is highly configurable at install time. These commands assume
the ""aide.conf"" file is under the ""/etc"" directory.

    Use the following command to determine if the file is in another location:

    # find / -name aide.conf

    Check the ""aide.conf"" file to determine if the ""sha512"" rule has been
added to the rule list being applied to the files and directories selection
lists.

    An example rule that includes the ""sha512"" rule follows:

    All=p+i+n+u+g+s+m+S+sha512+acl+xattrs+selinux
    /bin All # apply the custom rule to the files in bin
    /sbin All # apply the same custom rule to the files in sbin

    If the ""sha512"" rule is not being used on all uncommented selection lines
in the ""/etc/aide.conf"" file, or another file integrity tool is not using
FIPS 140-2 approved cryptographic hashes for validating file contents and
directories, this is a finding.

fix: Configure the file integrity tool to use FIPS 140-2 cryptographic hashes
for validating file and directory contents.

    If AIDE is installed, ensure the ""sha512"" rule is present on all
uncommented file and directory selection lists.

configurations are changed in an unauthorized manner.

    Note: A file integrity tool other than Advanced Intrusion Detection
Environment (AIDE) may be used, but the tool must be executed and notify
specified individuals via email or an alert.

    Check to see if AIDE is installed on the system with the following command:

    # yum list installed aide

    If AIDE is not installed, ask the SA how file integrity checks are
performed on the system.

    Check for the presence of a cron job running routinely on the system that
executes AIDE to scan for changes to the system baseline. The commands used in
the example will use a daily occurrence.

    Check the cron directories for a ""crontab"" script file controlling the
execution of the file integrity application. For example, if AIDE is installed
on the system, use the following command:

    # ls -al /etc/cron.* | grep aide
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 32 Jul 1 2011 aide

    # grep aide /etc/crontab /var/spool/cron/root
    /etc/crontab: 30 04 * * * /root/aide
    /var/spool/cron/root: 30 04 * * * /root/aide

    AIDE does not have a configuration that will send a notification, so the
cron job uses the mail application on the system to email the results of the
file integrity run as in the following example:

    # more /etc/cron.daily/aide
    #!/bin/bash

    /usr/sbin/aide --check | /bin/mail -s ""$HOSTNAME - Daily aide integrity
check run"" root@sysname.mil

changes, this is a finding.","Configure the operating system to notify designated personnel if baseline
configurations are changed in an unauthorized manner. The AIDE tool can be
configured to email designated personnel with the use of the cron system.

    The following example output is generic. It will set cron to run AIDE daily
and to send email at the completion of the analysis.

in ""/proc/sys/crypto"", this is a finding.

fix: Configure the operating system to implement DoD-approved encryption by
installing the dracut-fips package.

    To enable strict FIPS compliance, the fips=1 kernel option needs to be
added to the kernel command line during system installation so key generation
is done with FIPS-approved algorithms and continuous monitoring tests in place.

    Configure the operating system to implement DoD-approved encryption by
following the steps below:

    The fips=1 kernel option needs to be added to the kernel command line
during system installation so that key generation is done with FIPS-approved
algorithms and continuous monitoring tests in place. Users should also ensure
that the system has plenty of entropy during the installation process by moving
the mouse around, or if no mouse is available, ensuring that many keystrokes
are typed. The recommended amount of keystrokes is 256 and more. Less than 256
keystrokes may generate a non-unique key.

    Install the dracut-fips package with the following command:

    # yum install dracut-fips

    Recreate the ""initramfs"" file with the following command:

    Note: This command will overwrite the existing ""initramfs"" file.

    # dracut -f

    Modify the kernel command line of the current kernel in the ""grub.cfg""
file by adding the following option to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX key in the
""/etc/default/grub"" file and then rebuild the ""grub.cfg"" file:

    fips=1

    Changes to ""/etc/default/grub"" require rebuilding the ""grub.cfg"" file
as follows:

    On BIOS-based machines, use the following command:

    # grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

    On UEFI-based machines, use the following command:

    # grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg

    If /boot or /boot/efi reside on separate partitions, the kernel parameter
boot=<partition of /boot or /boot/efi> must be added to the kernel command
line. You can identify a partition by running the df /boot or df /boot/efi
command:

    # df /boot
    Filesystem 1K-blocks Used Available Use% Mounted on
    /dev/sda1 495844 53780 416464 12% /boot

    To ensure the ""boot="" configuration option will work even if device
naming changes occur between boots, identify the universally unique identifier
(UUID) of the partition with the following command:

    # blkid /dev/sda1
    /dev/sda1: UUID=""05c000f1-a213-759e-c7a2-f11b7424c797"" TYPE=""ext4""

    For the example above, append the following string to the kernel command
