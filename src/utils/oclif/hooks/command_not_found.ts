 * Hook that is triggered when an "oclif" command is not found.

 * @param opts - The options object containing the command ID.
 * @param opts.id - The ID of the command that was not found.
 *
 * @returns A promise that logs (outputs) an error message and exits the
 *          process with a status code of 1.
 *
 * @example
 * Invoking a non existing command like:
 *   $ saf emasser puts
 * It will result in oclif calling the command_not_found hook (this hook)
 * because there isn't a puts command, the command is put.
 *
 * However, it the command is:
 *   $ saf emasser puts -h
 * This hook is not called
